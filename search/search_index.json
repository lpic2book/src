Values related to CPU measurements are expressed as a percent of total CPU time. Keep this in mind when interpreting measurements from a multi-CPU system, as on these systems <code>vmstat</code> averages the number of CPUs into the output. All five CPU fields should add up to a total of 100% for each interval shown. This is independent of the number of processors or cores. In other words: <code>vmstat</code> can NOT be used to show statistics per processor or core (<code>mpstat</code> or <code>ps</code> should be used in that case). <code>vmstat</code> will accept delay in seconds and a number of counts (repetitions) as an argument, but the process and memory measurement results will always remain to be instantaneous.</p> <p>The first process column, \"r\" lists the number of processes currently allocated to the processor run queue. These processes are waiting for processor run time, also known as CPU time.</p> <p>The second process column, \"b\" lists the number of processes currently allocated to the block queue.

Microkernels are designed such that only the least possible amount of code is run in supervisor mode - this was never a design goal for Linux kernels. The Linux kernel is best described as a hybrid kernel: it is capable of loading and unloading code as microkernels do, but runs almost exclusively in supervisor mode, as monolithic kernels do.</p> <p>It is still possible to build the Linux kernel as a monolithic kernel. But it is rarely done, as updating device drivers requires a complete recompile of the kernel. However, building a monolithic kernel has its advantages too: it may have a smaller footprint as you can download and build just the parts you need and dependencies are clearer.</p> <p>When stored on disk most kernel images are compressed to save space. There are two types of compressed kernel types: <code>zImage</code> and <code>bzImage</code>.</p> <p><code>zImage</code> and <code>bzImage</code> files have different layouts and loading algorithms. The maximum allowed kernel size for a <code>zImage</code> is 512Kb, where a <code>bzImage</code> does not pose this limit. As a result the <code>bzImage</code> kernel is the preferred image type for larger kernels. <code>zImage</code> will be loaded in low memory and <code>bzImage</code> can also be loaded in high memory if needed.</p> <p>Note Both <code>zImage</code> and <code>bzImage</code> use gzip compression.

The kernel will try to access the disk to obtain the modules. However, as it has not loaded the proper module yet, it can't access that disk and hangs.</p> <p>A perfectly good solution would be to build a kernel with the required disk-driver hardcoded into it. But if you have a larger number of differing systems to maintain, you either need a personalised configuration and kernel for each type of system or have to live with a bloated kernel. To circumvent all of these problems, the kernel developers came up with a solution: the <code>initrd</code> RAM disk.</p> <p>A RAM disk is a chunk of memory that the kernel sees as if it were a disk. It can be mounted like any other disk. The kernel supports RAM disks by default. GRUB and LILO can handle RAM disks too. You can instruct them to load the RAM disk from a file and when the kernel boots it has the RAM disk readily available. Such RAM disks are often used to hold scripts and modules to aid the boot process.</p> <p>By convention the name of the image that holds the initial RAM disk is <code>initrd</code>. The name is short for \"initial ram disk\".</p> <p>The bootloader loads the <code>initrd</code>, it is mounted by the kernel as its root filesystem. Once mounted as the root filesystem, programs can be run from it and kernel modules loaded from it. After this step a new root filesystem can be mounted from a different device. The previous root (from <code>initrd</code>) is then either moved to the directory <code>/initrd</code> or it is unmounted.</p> <p>There are a number of ways to create your own <code>initrd</code> file. A very convenient method, mainly used by Red Hat (based) distributions is by using the <code>mkinitrd</code> script. It is a shell script which you might want to inspect to see how it works. On Debian-based distributions a utility named mkinitramfs <code>mkinitramfs</code> can be used for the same purpose.

Suitable block devices to be used for this purpose are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A RAM disk (fast, allocates physical memory)</p> </li> <li> <p>A loopback device (slightly slower, allocates disk space)</p> </li> </ol> <p>In the rest of this example we will use the RAM disk method, so we will need to make sure a RAM disk device node is present (there may be more than one):</p> <pre><code>    # ls -la /dev/ram0\n    brw-rw---- 1 root disk 1,  0 Feb 13 00:18 /dev/ram0\n</code></pre> <p>Note The number of RAM disks that is available by default on a system is an option in the kernel configuration: CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT.</p> <p>Next an empty filesystem needs to be created of the appropriate size:</p> <pre><code>    # mke2fs -m0 /dev/ram0 300\n</code></pre> <p>Note If space is critical, you may wish to use a filesystem which is more efficient with space, such as the Minix FS. Remember that the boot-kernel will need built-in support for whatever filesystem you choose.</p> <p>After having created the filesystem, you need to mount it on the appropriate directory:</p> <pre><code>    # mount -t ext2 /dev/ram0 /mnt\n</code></pre> <p>Now the stub for the console device needs to be created. This will be the device node that will be used when the <code>initrd</code> is active.</p> <pre><code>    # mkdir /mnt/dev\n    # mknod /mnt/dev/tty1 c 4 1\n</code></pre> <p>Next, copy all files you think are necessary to the image; modules, scripts, binaries, it does not matter. One of the most important files to copy over is <code>/linuxrc</code>. Whenever the kernel is set up to use a <code>initrd</code> image it will search for a file <code>/linuxrc</code> and execute it. It can be a script or a compiled binary. Hence, what will happen after mounting your image file is totally under your control. In this example we will make <code>/linuxrc</code> a link to <code>/bin/sh</code>. Make sure <code>/linuxrc</code> is given execute permissions.</p> <pre><code>    # ln -s /bin/sh /mnt/linuxrc\n</code></pre> <p>After you have completed copying the files and have made sure that the <code>/linuxrc</code> has the correct attributes, you can unmount the RAM disk image:</p> <pre><code>    # umount /dev/ram0\n</code></pre> <p>The RAM disk image can then be copied to a file:</p> <pre><code>    # dd if=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=300 of=/boot/initrd\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, if you have no more use for the RAM disk and you wish to reclaim the memory, deallocate the RAM disk:</p> <pre><code>    # freeramdisk /dev/ram0\n</code></pre> <p>To test the newly created <code>initrd</code>, add a new section to your GRUB menufile, which refers to the <code>initrd</code> image you've just created:</p> <pre><code>    title=initrd test entry\n    root (hd0,0)\n    kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.28\n    initrd /initrd\n</code></pre> <p>If you have followed the steps above and have rebooted using this test entry from the bootloader menu, the system will continue to boot. After a few seconds you should find yourself at a command prompt, since <code>/linuxrc</code> refers to <code>/bin/sh</code>, a shell.</p> <p>Of course, real <code>initrd</code> files will contain a more complex <code>/linuxrc</code> boot file, that loads modules, mounts the real root filesystem etc.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.201.2/#kernelpatching","title":"Patching a Kernel","text":"<p>Note This section offers information on a subject that is no longer part of the LPIC-2 objectives.

For example, supposing the file     name in the patch file was <code>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</code>, then     using <code>-p0</code> gives the entire file name unmodified, while using <code>-p1</code>     gives <code>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</code>.</li> </ul> <p><code>-s</code>; <code>--silent</code>; <code>--quiet</code></p> <ul> <li>Work silently (suppress output), unless an error occurs.</li> </ul> <p><code>-E</code>; <code>--remove-empty-files</code></p> <ul> <li>Remove output files that are empty after the patches have been     applied.

The     <code>-R</code> option does not work with <code>ed</code> diff scripts because there is     too little information to reconstruct the reverse operation. If the     first hunk of a <code>patch</code> fails, <code>patch</code> reverses the hunk to see if     it can be applied that way.

DKMS was created as a solution to combat software problems caused by the dependencies between kernels and kernel modules. As a vendor of computer systems running (amongst others) Linux operating systems, Dell offered software support to customers. When customers would upgrade the Linux kernel, the kernel modules had to be upgraded as well. And whenever Dell released newer versions of kernel modules for hardware support, these modules had to match the Linux kernel in use.</p> <p>DKMS is a framework, capable of automatically compiling and/or installing kernel modules for every kernel version available on the system. DKMS achieves this functionality by seperating the kernel module files or sources from the actual kernel source tree. This way, both the kernel and kernel modules may be upgraded independent of each other. Major Linux distributions offer the DKMS framework through their package system. When the kernel is upgraded by the package manager software on a system running DKMS, a hook will take care of deciding whether any kernel modules need to be compiled and/or installed for the new kernel. The other way around, new kernel modules can be compiled and/or installed by DKMS without requirements towards the kernel version.</p> <p>DKMS does have a few requirements in order to function properly. The software dependencies are dependant on the Linux distribution in use. But one requirement that is uniform across all distributions is the necessity for kernel header files. The headers for the running kernel version can be installed using the following package manager commands:</p> <p>On Red Hat based Linux distributions:</p> <pre><code>    $  yum install kernel-devel\n</code></pre> <p>On Debian-based Linux distributions:</p> <pre><code>    $ apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n</code></pre> <p>Due to the adoption of DKMS amongst major Linux distributions, many kernel modules available through package managers are (also) available as DKMS-modules. On Debian-based Linux systems, these DKMS kernel modules can be identified by their naming convention. The package names for these files end in <code>-dkms</code>. For example: <code>oss4-dkms</code>. After installation of these packages, the kernel module source files are placed within a corresponding <code>/usr/src/module-version</code> directory together with a <code>dkms.conf</code> configuration file. Whenever a kernel or kernel module change triggers the DKMS system, the directory specified by the <code>source_tree</code> variable from <code>/etc/dkms/framework.conf</code> will be checked for the existence of subdirectories containing <code>dkms.conf</code> files. The contents of these <code>dkms.conf</code> files then determine what happens next. The following example comes from a Debian-based Linux system and should clarify this explanation:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo apt-get install flashcache-dkms\n    $ ls /usr/src/\n    flashcache-3.1.1+git20140801  linux-headers-3.16.0-4-amd64  linux-headers-3.16.0-4-common  linux-kbuild-3.16 \n    $ ls /usr/src/flashcache-3.1.1+git20140801/\n    dkms.conf          flashcache.h        flashcache_ioctl.h  flashcache_procfs.c   flashcache_subr.c\n    flashcache_conf.c  flashcache_ioctl.c  flashcache_main.c   flashcache_reclaim.c  Makefile\n    $ cat /usr/src/flashcache-3.1.1+git20140801/dkms.conf \n    BUILT_MODULE_NAME=\"flashcache\"\n    DEST_MODULE_LOCATION=\"/kernel/drivers/block\"\n    PACKAGE_NAME=\"flashcache\"\n    PACKAGE_VERSION=\"3.1.1+git20140801\"\n    AUTOINSTALL=\"yes\"\n    REMAKE_INITRD=\"yes\"\n    MAKE=\"COMMIT_REV=3.1.1+git20140801 KERNEL_TREE=$kernel_source_dir make modules\"\n</code></pre> <p><code>BUILT_MODULE_NAME</code> determines the name of the compiled module. This directive is mandatory if the DKMS-module package contains more than one module. <code>DEST_MODULE_LOCATION</code> determines the location for the compiled module. The value for this directive should always start with \"/kernel\" which in turn redirects to <code>/lib/modules/kernelversion/kernel</code>. This value is mandatory except for the following Linux distributions which use a distribution specific directory: Fedora Core 6 and higher, RHEL 5 and higher, Novell SuSE Linux ES 10 and higher and Ubuntu. <code>PACKAGE_NAME</code> determines the name associated with the entire package of modules. This directive is mandatory. <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code> determines the version associated with the entire package of modules and is mandatory. <code>AUTOINSTALL</code> is a boolean value that determines whether or not the <code>dkms_autoinstaller</code> service will try to install this module for every kernel the system boots in to. <code>REMAKE_INITRD</code> determines whether the <code>initrd</code> image should be generated again after this module is installed. The value of this directive defaults to \"no\". When configuring a value, know that all characters after the first character are discared. The first character is only interpreted if it is a \"y\" or \"Y\". <code>MAKE</code> is one of many directives that stores its value in to an array. The <code>MAKE</code> value determines the build options. When not defined, DKMS will try to build the module using a generic <code>MAKE</code> command.</p> <p>On Debian-based Linux distributions, the directory <code>/usr/share/doc/dkms/examples</code> holds example configuration files. On Red Hat based Linux systems, example files can be found within the <code>/usr/share/doc/dkms</code> directory.</p> <p>After a module is built by DKMS, it is part of an extensible framework. DKMS provides several commands to issue on the module. Covering all these commands reaches beyond the scope of this book. But apart from <code>man dkms</code> the <code>dkms</code> command should be familiar. The <code>dkms</code> command makes it possible to <code>add</code> or <code>remove</code> modules to or from the source tree. Once part of the source tree, modules may be <code>build</code>. After building, a module may be installed onto the kernel it was build for using the <code>install</code> option. <code>uninstall</code> reverts this process. The <code>status</code> option prints information about added modules to standard output.</p> <p>The example above uses a module from the package manager. DKMS is also capable of accepting archive formats containing binary modules, module sources or both. When adding modules to DKMS this way it is important that the archive also contains a valid <code>dkms.conf</code> file. Using the <code>dkms mktarball</code> command, such an archive can be created based on modules extracted from the current system. This tarball archive can then be imported to the source tree using the <code>dkms ldtarball</code> command.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.201.2/#dracut","title":"Dracut","text":"<p>Just like DKMS may be configured to behave as an event-driven tool, <code>dracut</code> can behave in a similar way.

Communication between the userspace daemon and the kernel is done through the <code>sysfs</code> pseudo filesystem. The kernel sends the aforementioned \"uevents\" when it detects addition or removal of hardware, for example when you plug in your camera or USB disk. Based on a set of rules to match these uevents the kernel provides a dynamic device directory containing only device files for devices that are actually present, and can fire up scripts etc. to perform various actions. Hence, it is possible, for example, to plug in a camera, which will be automatically detected and properly mounted in the right place. After that a script might be started that copies all files to the local disk into a properly named subdirectory that will be created using the proper rights.</p> <p><code>/etc/udev/</code></p> <p>The <code>/etc/udev/</code> directory contains the configuration and the rule files for the udev utility. The <code>udev.conf</code> is the main configuration file for udev. Here, for instance, the logging priority can be changed.</p> <p><code>udev rules</code></p> <p><code>udev</code> rules are read from files located in the default rules directory. <code>/lib/udev/rules.d/</code>. Custom rules to override these default rules are specified in the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>When devices are initialized or removed, the kernel sends an 'uevent'. These uevents contain information such as the subsystem (e.g. net, sub), action and attributes (e.g. mac, vendor). <code>udev</code> listens to these events, matches the uevent information to the specified rules, and responds accordingly.</p> <p>A <code>udev</code> rule consists of multiple key value pairs separated by a comma. Each key value pair represents either a match key, that matches to information provided with the uevent or an assign key, which assign values, names and actions to the device nodes maintained by <code>udev</code>:</p> <pre><code>    SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"ADD\", DRIVERS=\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"00:21:86:9e:c2:c4\", \n    ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL=\"eth*\", NAME==\"eth0\"\n</code></pre> <p>The rule specified above would add a device <code>/dev/eth0</code> for a network card with MAC address 00:21:86:9e:c2:c4</p> <p>As shown, a key value pair also specifies an operator. Depending on the used operator, different actions are taken. Valid operators are: ==, Compare for equality, !=, Compare for inequality, =, Assign a value to a key. Keys that represent a list, are reset and only this single value is assigned, +=, Add the value to a key finally; disallow any later changes, which may be used to prevent changes by any later rules</p> <p>When specifying rules, be careful not to create conflicting rules (e.g. do not point two different netword cards to the same device name). Also, changing device names into something else could cause userpsace software incompatibilities. You have power, use it wisely.</p> <p><code>udevmonitor</code></p> <p><code>udevmonitor</code> will print <code>udev</code> and kernel uevents to standard output. You can use it to analyze event timing by comparing the timestamps of the kernel uevent and the <code>udev</code> event. Usually <code>udevmonitor</code> is a symbolic link to <code>udevadm</code>. In some distributions, this symbolic link no longer exists. To access the monitor on these systems, use the command <code>udevadm monitor</code>.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.0/","title":"System Startup (202)","text":"<p>This topic has a total weight of 9 points and contains the following 3 objectives:</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.0/#objective-2021-customizing-sysv-init-system-startup-3-points","title":"Objective 202.1 Customizing SysV-init system startup (3 points)","text":"<ul> <li>Candidates should be able to query and modify the behaviour of     system services at various run levels.

Definitions in this directory take precedence over the files in <code>/usr/lib/systemd</code> but not over those in <code>/etc/systemd</code>. Overrides in <code>/run/systemd</code> will only be used until the system is rebooted since all files in <code>/run/systemd</code> will be deleted at a reboot of the system.</p> <p>systemd-delta To get an overview of all overrides active you can use the <code>systemd-delta</code> command. This command can return the following types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>masked</p> <ul> <li>Masked units, units that can't be started.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>equivalent</p> <ul> <li>Overridden files that do not differ in content.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>redirected</p> <ul> <li>Symbolic links to other unit files.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>overridden</p> <ul> <li>Overridden unit files.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>extended</p> <ul> <li>Extended unit files using a .conf file.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>You can also filter by the types above using the <code>-t</code> of <code>--type=</code> flags, these take a list of the above types. If you also want to see unchanged files you can add <code>unchanged</code> as a type. Other options you can use are <code>--diff=false</code> if you don't want <code>systemd-delta</code> to show the diffs of overridden files, and <code>--no-pager</code> if you don't want the output piped to a pager.</p> <p>Now that we know where the unit files are stored and how we can override them we can take a look at changing system states.</p> <p>For getting and changing the (default) system state we use the <code>systemctl</code> command. A full explanation of the possibilities for this command can be found in chapter 206.3.</p> <p>If we want to get the default target we can run the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl get-default\n</code></pre> <p>This will output the current default target which is used at boot. To get a list of all currently loaded target units you can run the following commandL</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl list-units --type=target\n</code></pre> <p>This will give you a list of all currently active targets. To get all available target units you can run the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl list-unit-files --type=target\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to change the default target you can use the <code>systemctl set-default</code> command. For example, to set the default target to multi-user.target you can run the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n</code></pre> <p>This command will create a symbolic link <code>/etc/systemd/system/default.target</code> which links to the target file in <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>.</p> <p>A comparison between the init runlevels and the system targets:</p> Runlevel Target Description 0 runlevel0.target, poweroff.target Shutdown and poweroff the system. 1 runlevel1.target, rescue.target Set up a rescue shell. 2 runlevel2.target, multi-user.target Set up a non-graphical multi-user system. 3 runlevel3.target, multi-user.target Set up a non-graphical multi-user system. 4 runlevel4.target, multi-user.target Set up a non-graphical multi-user system. 5 runlevel5.target, graphical.target Set up a graphical multi-user system. 6 runlevel6.target, reboot.target Shutdown and reboot the system. <p>You can also change the system state at runtime, this can be done using the <code>systemctl isolate</code> command. This will stop all services not defined for the chosen target, and start all the services that are defined for the target.</p> <p>For example, to go to rescue mode, you can run the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl isolate rescue.target\n</code></pre> <p>This will stop all services except those defined for the rescue target. Note that this command will not notify any logged in users of the action.</p> <p>There are also some shortcuts available to change the system state, these have an added bonus that they will notify the logged in users of the action. For example, another way to get the system into rescue mode is the following:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl rescue\n</code></pre> <p>This will first notify the logged in users of the action and then stop all services not defined in the target. If you don't want the users to get notified you can add the <code>--no-wall</code> flag.</p> <p>If your system is too broken to use rescue mode there is also an emergency mode available. This can be started by using the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl emergency\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to start certain services at boot you have to enable them. You can enable services using the <code>systemctl enable</code> command. For example, to enable sshd you run the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl enable sshd.service\n</code></pre> <p>To disable the service again you use <code>systemctl disable</code>. For example:</p> <pre><code>    $ systemctl disable sshd.service\n</code></pre> <p>The unit file of the service defines at which system state the service will be running. This is configured by setting the <code>WantedBy=</code> option under the <code>[Install]</code> section. If this is set to <code>multi-user.target</code> than it will run in both non-graphical as graphical mode.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.1/#the-lsb-standard","title":"The LSB standard","text":"<p>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines an interface for application programs that are compiled and packaged for LSB-conforming implementations. Hence, a program which was compiled in an LSB compatible environment will run on any distribution that supports the LSB standard. LSB compatible programs can rely on the availability of certain standard libraries. The standard also includes a list of mandatory utilities and scripts which define an environment suitable for installation of LSB-compatible binaries.</p> <p>The specification includes processor architecture specific information. This implies that the LSB is a family of specifications, rather than a single one. In other words: if your LSB compatible binary was compiled for an Intel based system, it will not run on, for example, an Alpha based LSB compatible system, but will install and run on any Intel based LSB compatible system. The LSB specifications therefore consist of a common and an architecture-specific part; \"LSB-generic\" or \"generic LSB\" and \"LSB-arch\" or \"archLSB\".</p> <p>The LSB standard lists which generic libraries should be available, e.g. <code>libdl</code>, <code>libcrypt</code>, <code>libpthread</code> and so on, and provides a list of processor specific libraries, like <code>libc</code> and <code>libm</code>. The standard also lists searchpaths for these libraries, their names and format (ELF). Another section handles the way dynamic linking should be implemented. For each standard library a list of functions is given, and data definitions and accompanying header files are listed.</p> <p>The LSB defines a list of 130+ commands that should be available on an LSB compatible system, and their calling conventions and behaviour. Some examples are <code>cp</code>, <code>tar</code>, <code>kill</code> and <code>gzip</code>, and the runtime languages <code>perl</code> and <code>python</code>.</p> <p>The expected behaviour of an LSB compatible system during system initialization is part of the LSB specification. So is a definition of the <code>cron</code> system, and are actions, functions and location of the <code>init</code> scripts. Any LSB compliant init script should be able to handle the following options: <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>restart</code>, <code>force-reload</code> and <code>status</code>. The <code>reload</code> and <code>try-restart</code> options are optional. The standard also lists the definitions for runlevels and listings of user- and groupnames and their corresponding UID's/GID's.</p> <p>Though it is possible to install an LSB compatible program without the use of a package manager (by applying a script that contains only LSB compliant commands), the LSB specification contains a description for software packages and their naming conventions.</p> <p>Note LSB employs the Red Hat Package Manager standard. Debian based LSB compatible distributions may read RPM packages by using the <code>alien</code> command.</p> <p>The LSB standards frequently refers to other well known standards, for example ISO/IEC 9945-2009 (Portable OS base, very Unix like).

Subsequently, it is likely that some processes need to be stopped and others need to be started.</p> <p>Recall that the initscripts for a runlevel \"X\" are grouped in directory <code>/etc/rc.d/rcX.d</code> (or, on newer (LSB based) systems, in <code>/etc/init.d/rcX.d</code>). The filenames determine how the scripts are called: if the name starts with a \"K\", the script will be run with the <code>stop</code> option, if the name starts with a \"S\", the script will be run with the <code>start</code> option. The normal procedure during a runlevel change is to stop the superfluous processes first and then start the new ones.</p> <p>The actual init scripts are located in <code>/etc/init.d</code>. The files you find in the <code>rcX.d</code> directory are symbolic links which link to these. In many cases, the start- and stop-scripts are symbolic links to the same script. This implies that such init scripts should be able to handle at least the <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> options.</p> <p>For example, the symbolic link named <code>S06syslog</code> in <code>/etc/init.d/rc3.d</code> might point to the script <code>/etc/init.d/syslog</code>, as may the symbolic link found in <code>/etc/init.d/rc2.d</code>, named <code>K17syslog</code>.</p> <p>The order in which services are stopped or started can be of great importance. Some services may be started simultaneously, others need to start in a strict order. For example your network needs to be up before you can start the <code>httpd</code>. The order is determined by the names of the symbolic links. The naming conventions dictate that the names of init scripts (the ones found in the <code>rcN.d</code> directories) include two digits, just after the initial letter. They are executed in alphabetical order.</p> <p>In the early days system administrators created these links by hand. Later most Linux distributors decided to provide Linux commands/scripts which allow the administrator to disable or enable certain scripts in certain runlevels and to check which systems (commands) would be started in which runlevel. These commands typically will manage both the aforementioned links and will name these in such a way that the scripts are run in the proper order.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.1/#the-chkconfig-command","title":"The <code>chkconfig</code> command","text":"<p>Another tool to manage the proper linking of start up (init) scripts is <code>chckconfig</code>. On some systems (e.g. SuSE/Novell) it serves as a front-end for <code>insserv</code> and uses the LSB standardized comment block to maintain its administration. On older systems it maintains its own special comment section, that has a much simpler and less flexible syntax. This older syntax consists of two lines, one of them is a description of the service, it starts with the keyword <code>description:</code>. The other line starts with the keyword <code>chkconfig:</code>, and lists the run levels for which to start the service and the priority (which determines in what order the scripts will be run while changing runlevels). For example:</p> <pre><code>    # Init script for foo daemon\n    #\n    # description: food, the foo daemon\n    # chkconfig: 2345 55 25\n    #\n    #\n</code></pre> <p>This denotes that the <code>foo</code> daemon will start in runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5, will have priority 55 in the queue of initscripts that are run during startup and priority 25 in the queue of initscripts that are run if the daemon needs to be stopped.</p> <p>The <code>chkconfig</code> utility can be used to list which services will be started in which runlevels, to add a service to or to delete it from a runlevel and to add an entire service to or to delete it from the startup scripts.</p> <p>Note We are providing some examples here, but be warned: there are various versions of <code>chkconfig</code> around. Please read the manual pages for the <code>chkconfig</code> command on your distribution first.</p> <p><code>chkconfig</code> does not automatically disable or enable a service immediately, but simply changes the symbolic links. If the <code>cron</code> daemon is running and you are on a Red Hat based system which is running in runlevel 2, the command</p> <pre><code>    # chkconfig --levels 2345 crond off\n</code></pre> <p>would change the administration but would not stop the <code>cron</code> daemon immediately. Also note that on a Red Hat system it is possible to specify more than one runlevel, as we did in our previous example. On Novell/SuSE systems, you may use:</p> <pre><code>    # chkconfig food 2345\n</code></pre> <p>and to change this so it only will run in runlevel 1 simply use</p> <pre><code>    # chkconfig food 1\n\n\n    # chkconfig --list\n</code></pre> <p>will list the current status of services and the runlevels in which they are active. For example, the following two lines may be part of the output:</p> <pre><code>    xdm                       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:on    6:off\n    xfs                       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off\n</code></pre> <p>They indicate that the xfs service is not started in any runlevel and the xdm service only will be started while switching to runlevel 5.</p> <p>To add a new service, let's say the <code>foo</code> daemon, we create a new init script and name it after the service, in this case we might use <code>food</code>.

The advantage of its modular design is that as new filesystems and/or storage solutions are added to the kernel, boot support can easily be added to GRUB 2 in separate modules.</p> <p>Examples of boot support added by such modules are modules for filesystem support (like ext4, NTFS, btrf and zfs), and LVM and software RAID devices.</p> <p>GRUB is able to boot many operating systems, both free and proprietary ones. Open operating systems, like FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Linux, are supported by GRUB directly. Proprietary kernels (e.g. DOS, Windows and OS/2) are supported using GRUB's chain-loading function. Chain-loading implies that GRUB will be used to boot the system, and in turn will load and run the proprietary systems bootloader, which then boots the operating system.</p> <p>The GRUB boot process features both a menu interface and a command-line interface (CLI). The CLI called is called the GRUB shell and allows you to execute commands to select a root device (<code>root</code> command), load a kernel from it (<code>linux</code> command) and, if necessary load some additional kernel modules (<code>insmod</code>) and subsequently boot the kernel (<code>boot</code> command). The menu interface offers a quick selection method of the desired runtime environment. While booting, both interfaces are available. On boot the menu is displayed, and the user can simply choose one of the menu entries. Without user interaction, the system will boot the default entry after a pre-defined time value has passed.</p> <p>Alternatively, the user can hit e to edit the current entry before booting, or hit c to enter the CLI.

If GRUB is used, the MBR contains a copy of the first stage of GRUB, which tries to load stage 2.</p> <p>To be able to load stage 2, GRUB needs to have access to code to handle the filesystem(s). There are many filesystem types and the code to handle them will not fit within the 512 byte MBR, even less so since the MBR also contains the partitioning table. The GRUB parts that deal with filesystems are therefore stored in the so-called DOS compatibility region. That region consists of sectors on the same cylinder where the MBR resides (cylinder 0). In the old days, when disks were adressed using the CHS (Cylinder/Head/Sector) specification, the MBR typically would load DOS. DOS requires that its image is on the same cylinder. Therefore, by tradition, the first cylinder on a disk is reserved and it is this space that GRUB uses to store the filesystem code. That section is referred to as stage 1.5. Stage 1.5 is commonly referred to as the <code>core.img</code>; it is constructed from several files by the installer, based on the filesystem(s) grub needs to support during boot.</p> <p>Stage 2 contains most of the boot-logic. It presents a menu to the end-user and an additional command prompt, where the user can manually specify boot-parameters. GRUB is typically configured to automatically load a particular kernel after a timeout period. Once the end-user made his/her selection, GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel. At this stage GRUB can pass control of the boot process to another loader using chain loading if required by the operating system.</p> <p>grub-install In Linux, the <code>grub-install</code> command is used to install stage 1 to either the MBR or within a partition.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.2/#influencing-the-regular-boot-process","title":"Influencing the regular boot process","text":"<p>The regular boot process is the process that normally takes place when GRUB (re)booting the system.

Early BIOS versions required manual configuration of physical jumpers on the motherboard. Later versions replaced the manual jumper routine by a software menu, capable of providing an interface to configure the most elementary computer settings. As convenient as this may sound, the constant evolution of computer systems evolved to a point where even the most sophisticated BIOS software proved to have its limitations. To combat these limitations, Intel developed the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) system in 1998 as a BIOS replacement. The EFI system dit not catch on, until the standard was adopted by the UEFI Forum around 2005. The standard was then (re)branded from EFI to UEFI (Universal Extensible Firmware Interface). UEFI is sometimes also referred to as (U)EFI. Linux kernel 3.15 and newer should be able to use the UEFI advantages.</p> <p>What are these advantages you may ask? To answer that question we have to look at the BIOS limitations first. One of the limitations of BIOS systems is noticable when booting operating systems. Traditionally, a BIOS can be configured to use one or more boot devices in a specific order. A boot device can be an optical drive, a harddrive, a portable USB volume or a network interface card. After the BIOS has performed the POST (Power On Self Test), each configured boot device will be checked for the existence of a boot loader. The first bootloader detected will be loaded. In case of a harddrive, the BIOS expects the bootloader to be located at sector 0 or the MBR*(Master Boot Record). Since the MBR only allows for a small amount of data (446 bytes) to be stored, the MBR usually contains instructions that point to another piece of code on disk. This two stage approach is known as *chainloading. This other piece of code could then consist of a boot manager. A boot manager is capable of loading operating systems located at various locations on the storage volumes. Both the first and second stage of the boot code have to be stored within the first MegaByte of available storage on the harddrive.</p> <p>UEFI uses a different approach. Instead of being limited to the MBR contents of one specific drive, UEFI reads boot data from an ESP partition. ESP stands for EFI System Partition. The ESP is a designated boot partition. The filesystem is usually of the type FAT , and it can hold any size of bootloader, or even multiple ones. On Linux systems, the ESP is usually mounted as <code>/boot/efi</code>. Underneath that mountpoint will be a directory structure that depends on the Operating System in use. The boot files located within those directories carry a <code>.efi</code> extension. With UEFI, the UEFI software acts as a mini-bootloader looking for filenames ending in <code>.efi</code> within pre-defined locations. On a Fedora based system, the contents of the ESP may look as follows:</p> <pre><code>    # cd /boot/efi/\n    # ls -a\n    .  ..  EFI\n    #  cd EFI\n    #  ls\n    BOOT  fedora\n    # ls -l BOOT\n    total 1332\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1293304 May 17  2016 BOOTX64.EFI\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   66072 May 17  2016 fallback.efi\n    # ls -l fedora/\n    total 3852\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     104 May 17  2016 BOOT.CSV\n    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 Sep 28 22:17 fw\n    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   70864 Sep 28 22:17 fwupx64.efi\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1276192 May 17  2016 MokManager.efi\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1293304 May 17  2016 shim.efi\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1287000 May 17  2016 shim-fedora.efi\n</code></pre> <p>In the example above, every file ending in <code>.efi</code> can add functionality to the UEFI system. So, whereas BIOS based systems depend on harddrive metadata to boot up a system, UEFI based systems are capable of reading files within the ESP portion of the harddrive. UEFI offers backwards compatibility towards legacy BIOS functions, while at the same time offering more advanced functions for modern computers. Computers using BIOS software have trouble dealing with todays 8TB harddrives. UEFI based computers are able to use GPT disk layouts that defeat the 2TB partition limit of their BIOS counterparts. The UEFI software comes with network support for IPv4 and IPv6. TCP and UDP are supported, and booting remote boot media is supported using TFTP and even HTTP. Booting over HTTP does require UEFI 2.5 or newer. Version 2.5 was released in Januari 2016.</p> <p>LPIC-2 exam candidates should be aware of the possibility to switch between UEFI and Legacy BIOS boot modes on modern computers. Despite the advantages that UEFI may have, there are also requirements that should be met. The <code>.efi</code> boot files are expected to be located beneath a certain path. When Secure Boot is enabled, the boot code has to be digitally signed. Otherwise, systems may encounter boot issues. When troubleshooting boot issues on a modern Linux computer, try to distinguish MBR from GPT disk layouts. When using the UEFI boot mode, confirm that the Linux distribution in use can also handle UEFI boot. When Secure Boot is enabled, confirm that the required conditions are met. When in doubt, switch back to \"Legacy BIOS\" or equivalent within the UEFI interface. When booting from USB, it may be necessary to enable 'Legacy USB' settings for Mass Storage Devices in the UEFI interface.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.202.2/#nvm","title":"NVM","text":"<p>In the previous chapter, 8TB harddrives are mentioned as a result of recent computer storage evolution. These conventional SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachmenti) harddrives have moving parts, and are controlled using a protocol called AHCI (Advanced Host Configuration Interface). In recent years, SSD (Solid State Disk) harddrives have become more popular. One of the advantages of these drives is the lack of moving parts. This makes SSD harddrives not only more energy efficient but also faster than mechanical harddrives. Because the SSD drives have to be compatible with existing computers, they are connected with the same SATA connector mechanical harddrives use. And they also use the same AHCI protocol. This protocol was initially designed with mechanical harddrives in mind. AHCI uses 1 queue with 32 commands to control the harddrive. This poses a bottleneck for the newer generation of SSD harddrives. To combat this bottleneck, a new technology called NVMe (Non Volatile Memory Express) has been developed. NVMe allows SSD harddrives to connect to a NVMe controller that is connected to the PCI-E bus on the motherboard. The SSD harddisk is then controlled using the NVMHCI (Non Volatile Memory Host Configuration Interface) protocol. Instead of 1 queue holding 32 commands at a time, the SSD can now be controlled using 65.000 queues holding up to 65.000 commands each. This is possible because the PCI-E bus is much faster than the SATA bus. The latest generation of fast SSD harddrives can achieve throughput speeds up to seven times faster using NVMe when compared to PCI-E connected AHCI harddrives.</p> <p>Just as traditional harddrives connected to a Linux computer are represented by <code>/dev/hda*</code> or <code>/dev/sda*</code> references, NVMe harddrives are represented by <code>/dev/nvme*</code> within the Linux filesystem tree. When working with these harddrives, be aware that the disk notation starts at <code>0</code>, but the namespace and partition on disk start at <code>1</code>. Therefore, the first partition on the first namespace on the first NVMe harddrive of a system is represented by <code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code>.

To allow clients to provide more information about themselves and to retrieve tailored information, BOOTP received the BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions [RFC 1048], which in turn was enhanced with a new protocol, DHCP. DHCP extended BOOTP with a number of standard options, defining different types of messages.

The word is also used to refer to a partition or disk that is used to store the files or the type of the filesystem. Thus, one might say \"I have two filesystems\" meaning one has two partitions on which files are stored, or one might say \"I am using the XFS filesystem\", meaning the type of the XFS filesystem.</p> <p>The difference between a disk or partition and the partition filesystem it contains is important. A few programs (including those that create filesystems) operate directly on the raw sectors of a disk or partition; if a filesystem is already there it will be destroyed or seriously corrupted. Most programs operate on a filesystem, and therefore won't work on a partition that doesn't contain one (or that contains a filesystem of the wrong type).</p> <p>Before a partition or disk can be used as a filesystem, it needs to be initialized, and the bookkeeping data structures need to be written to the disk.

The central superblock inode directory blocks indirection blocks concepts are superblock, inode, data block, directory block, and indirection block. The superblock contains information about the filesystem as a whole, such as its size (the exact information here depends on the filesystem). An inode contains all information about a file, except its name. The name is stored in the directory, together with the number of the inode. A directory entry consists of a filename and the number of the inode which represents the file. The inode contains the numbers of several data blocks, which are used to store the data in the file. There is space only for a few data block numbers in the inode, however, and if more are needed, more space for pointers to the data blocks is allocated dynamically.

Hence to add a new device with a filesystem on it its filesystem needs to be made part of that one directory tree. The way this is done is by attaching the new filesystem under an existing (preferably empty) directory, which is part of the existing directory tree - the \"<code>mount</code>\" point.</p> <p>To attach a new file system to the directory mount unmount hierarchy you must mount its associated device file. First you will need to create the mount point; a directory where the device will be attached. As directories are part of a filesystem too the mount point exists on a previously mounted device. It should be empty. If is is not the files in the directory will not be visible while the device is mounted to it, but will reappear after the device has been disconnected (or unmounted). This type of security by obscurity is sometimes used to hide information from the casual onlooker.</p> <p>To mount a device, use the mount command:</p> <pre><code>    mount [options] device_file mount_point\n</code></pre> <p>With some devices, mount will detect what type of filesystem exists on the device, however it is more usual to use mount in the form of:</p> <pre><code>    mount [options] -t file_system_type device_file mount_point\n</code></pre> <p>Generally, only the root user can use the mount command - mainly due to the fact that the device files are owned by root. For example, to mount the first partition on the second (IDE) hard drive off the <code>/usr</code> directory and assuming it contained the ext2 filesystem, you'd enter the command:</p> <pre><code>    mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb1 /usr\n</code></pre> <p>A common device that is mounted is the floppy drive. A floppy disk generally contains the FAT, also known as msdos, filesystem (but not always) FAT and is mounted with the command:</p> <pre><code>    mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the floppy disk was mounted under the <code>/mnt</code> directory. This is because the <code>/mnt</code> directory is the usual place to temporarily mount devices.</p> <p>To see which devices you currently have mounted, simply type the command <code>mount</code>. Some sample output:</p> <pre><code>    /dev/hda3 on / type ext2 (rw)\n    /dev/hda1 on /dos type msdos (rw)\n    none on /proc type proc (rw)\n    /dev/cdrom on /cdrom type iso9660 (ro)\n    /dev/fd0 on /mnt type msdos (rw)\n</code></pre> <p>Each line shows which device file is mounted, where it is iso9660 mounted, what filesystem type each partition is and how it is mounted (<code>ro</code> = read only, <code>rw</code> = read/write). Note the strange entry on line three NDASH the proc filesystem. This is a special \"virtual\" filesystem used by Linux systems to store information about the kernel, processes and current resource usage. It is actually part of the system's memory NDASH in other words, the kernel sets aside an area of memory in which it stores information about the system. This same area is mounted onto the filesystem so that user programs have access to this information.</p> <p>The information in the proc filesystem can also be used to see which filesystems are mounted by issuing the command: /proc/mounts</p> <pre><code>    $ cat /proc/mounts\n    /dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0\n    proc /proc proc rw 0 0\n    /dev/hda1 /dos msdos rw 0 0\n    /dev/cdrom /cdrom iso9660 ro 0 0\n    /dev/fd0 /mnt msdos rw 0 0\n</code></pre> <p>The difference between <code>/etc/mtab</code> and <code>/proc/mounts</code> is that <code>/etc/mtab</code> is the user space administration kept by <code>mount</code>, and <code>/proc/mounts</code> is the information kept by the kernel. The latter reflects the information in user space. Due to these different implementations the info in <code>/proc/mounts</code> is always up-to-date, while the info in <code>/etc/mtab</code> may become inconsistent.</p> <p>To release a device and disconnect it from the filesystem, the umount command is used. It is issued in the form: umount</p> <pre><code>    umount device_file\n</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>    umount mount_point\n</code></pre> <p>For example, to release the floppy disk, you'd issue the command:</p> <pre><code>    umount /dev/fd0\n</code></pre> <p>or</p> <pre><code>    umount /mnt\n</code></pre> <p>Again, you must be the root user or a user with privileges to do this. You can't unmount a device/mount point that is in use by a user (e.g. the user's current working directory is within the mount point) or is in use by a process. Nor can you unmount devices/mount points which in turn have devices mounted to them.</p> <p>The system needs to mount devices during boot. In true UNIX fashion, there is a file which governs the behaviour of mounting devices at boot time. In Linux, this file is <code>/etc/fstab</code>. Lines from the /etc/fstabfile use the following format:</p> <pre><code>    device_file mount_point file_system_type mount_options [n] [n]\n</code></pre> <p>The first three fields are self explanatory; the fourth field, <code>mount_options</code> defines how the device will be mounted (this includes information of access mode <code>ro</code> / <code>rw</code> , execute permissions and other information) - information on this can be found in the <code>mount</code> man pages (note that this field usually contains the word \"defaults\" ). The fifth and sixth fields are used by the system utilities <code>dump</code> and <code>fsck</code> respectively - see the next section for details.</p> <p>There's also a file called <code>/etc/mtab</code>. It lists the currently mounted partitions in fstab form.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.203.1/#systemd-mount-units","title":"Systemd Mount Units","text":"<p>Linux distributions that have adopted the systemd initialization system have an additional way of mounting filesystems. Instead of using the <code>fstab</code> file for persistent mounting, a filesystem can be configured using a mount unit file. This mount unit file holds the configuration details for systemd to persistently mount filesystems.</p> <p>A systemd mount unit file has a specific naming convention. The file name refers to the absolute directory it will be mounted on and the file extension is <code>.mount</code>. For the name of the file the first and last forward slash (/) of the mount path it represents are removed and the remaining slashes are converted to a dash (-). So if, for example, a filesystem is mounted to the mount point <code>/home/user/data/</code> the mount unit file must be named <code>home-user-data.mount</code></p> <p>In the mount file three required sections are defined: <code>[Unit]</code>, <code>[Mount]</code> and <code>[Install]</code>.

Linux can use either a normal file in the filesystem or a swap separate partition for swap space. A swap partition is faster, but it is easier to change the size of a swap file (there's no need to repartition the whole hard disk, and possibly install everything from scratch). When you know how much swap space you need, you should use a swap partition, but if you are in doubt, you could use a swap file first, and use the system for a while so that you can get a feel for how much swap you need, and then make a swap partition when you're confident about its size. It is recommended to use a separate partition, because this excludes chances of file system fragmentation, which would reduce performance. Also, by using a separate swap partition, it can be guaranteed that the swap region is at the fastest location of the disk. On current HDDs this is at the beginning of the platters (outside rim, first cylinders). It is possible to use several swap partitions and/or swap files at the same time. This means that if you only occasionally need an unusual amount of swap space, you can set up an extra swap file at such times, instead of keeping the whole amount allocated all the time.</p> <p>The command <code>mkswap</code> is used to initialize a mkswap swap partition or a swap file. The partition or file needs to exist before it can be initialized. A swap partition is created with a disk partitioning tool like <code>fdisk</code> and a swap file can be created with: /dev/zero</p> <pre><code>    dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=65535\n</code></pre> <p>When the partition or file is created, it can be initialized with:</p> <pre><code>    mkswap {device|file}\n</code></pre> <p>An initialized swap space is taken into use with <code>swapon</code>. This swapon command tells the kernel that the swap space may be used. The path to the swap space is given as the argument, so to start swapping on a temporary swap file one might use the following command:</p> <pre><code>    swapon /swapfile\n</code></pre> <p>or, when using a swap partition:</p> <pre><code>    swapon /dev/hda8\n</code></pre> <p>Swap spaces may be used automatically by listing them in the file <code>/etc/fstab</code>:</p> <pre><code>    /dev/hda8 none swap sw 0 0\n    /swapfile none swap sw 0 0\n</code></pre> <p>The startup scripts will run the command <code>swapon              -a</code>, which will start swapping on all the swap spaces listed in <code>/etc/fstab</code>. Therefore, the swapon command is usually used only when extra swap is needed. You can monitor the use of swap spaces with free <code>free</code>. It will report the total amount of swap space used:</p> <pre><code>    $ free\n    total used free shared buffers cached\n    Mem: 127148 122588 4560 50 1584 69352\n    -/+ buffers/cache: 51652 75496\n    Swap: 130748 57716 73032\n</code></pre> <p>The first line of output (<code>Mem:</code>) shows the physical memory.

It's a 128 bit number that can be used to identify basically anything. Generating such UUIDs can be done using appropriate software. There are 5 various versions of UUIDs, all of them use a (pseudo)random element, current system time and some mostly unique hardware ID, for example a MAC address. Theoretically there is a very, very remote chance of an UUID not being unique, but this is seen as impossible in practice.</p> <p>On Linux, support for UUIDs was started within the e2fsprogs package. With filesystems, UUIDs are used to represent a specific filesystem. You can for example use the UUID in <code>/etc/fstab</code> to represent the partition which you want to mount.</p> <p>Usually, a UUID is represented as 32 hexadecimal digits, grouped in sequences of 8,4,4,4 and 12 digits, separated by hyphens.

UUIDs come in handy when disks are moved to different connectors or computers, multiple operating systems are installed on the computer, or other cases where device names could change while keeping the filesystem intact.

For example, when you use mke2fs to reformat partition <code>/dev/sda3</code>, the UUID will be changed.

But if you do the command <code>ls /var/autofs/floppy</code>, you don't see anything even though the directory <code>/var/autofs/floppy/floppy</code> should exist. That is because <code>/var/autofs/floppy/floppy</code> does not exist yet. Only when you directly try to access that directory the automounter will mount it.</p> <p>Each device should have its own supplementary file. So, for example, configuration data for the floppy drive and that of the cdrom drive should not be combined into the same supplementary file. Each definition in the <code>/etc/auto.master</code> file results in spawning its own <code>automount</code> daemon. If you have several devices running under control of the same automount daemon - which is legit - but one of the devices fails, the daemon may hang or be suspended and other devices it controls might not be mounted properly either. Hence it is good practice to have every device under control of its own automount daemon and so there should be just one device per supplementary file per entry in the <code>/etc/auto.master</code> file.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.203.3/#automount-with-systemd","title":"Automount with systemd","text":"<p>To initiate automount with systemd a unit file should be created in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>.

A writable CD is only writable once so if we wrote an empty filesystem to it, it would get formatted and remain completely empty forever. This is also true for re-writable media as you cannot change arbitrary sectors yet; you must erase the whole disk. The tool to create the filesystem is called <code>mkisofs</code>. A sample usage looks like this: mkisofs</p> <pre><code>    $ mkisofs -r -o cd_image private_collection/\n</code></pre> <p>The option <code>-r</code> sets the permissions of all files on the CD to be public readable and enables Rock Ridge extensions.

In case of naming conflicts (different files have the same 8.3 name), numbers are used in the filenames and information about the chosen filename is printed via STDERR (usually the screen). Don't panic: Under Linux you will never see these odd 8.3 filenames because Linux makes use of the Rock Ridge extensions which contain the original Rock Ridge file information (permissions, filename, etc.).

You can also use <code>mkhybrid</code> to create HFS CD-ROMS HFS Read the man-page for details on the various options. Another extention is El Torito, which is used to create bootable CD-ROM filesystems.</p> <p>Besides the ISO9660 filesystem as created by <code>mkisofs</code> there is the UDF (Universal Disk Format) filesystem. The Optical Storage Technology Association standardized the UDF filesystem to form a common filesystem for all (read-only and re-writable) optical media.

This array of drives will appear to the computer as a single logical storage unit or drive.</p> <p>Some of the concepts used in this chapter are important factors in deciding which level of RAID to use in a particular situation. Parity is a concept used to add redundancy to storage. A parity bit is a binary digit which is added to ensure that the number of bits with value of one in a given set of bits is always even or odd. By using part of the capacity of the RAID for storing parity bits in a clever way, single disk failures can happen without data-loss since the missing bit can be recalculated using the parity bit. I/O transactions are movements of data to or from a RAID device or its members. Each I/O transaction consists of one or more blocks of data. A single disc can handle a maximum random number of transactions per second, since the mechanism has a seek time before data can be read or written. Depending on the configuration of the RAID, a single I/O transaction to the RAID can trigger multiple I/O transactions to its members. This affects the performance of the RAID device in terms of maximum number of I/O transactions and data transfer rate. Data transfer rate is the amount of data a single disk or RAID device can handle per second. This value usually varies for read and write actions, random or sequential access etc.</p> <p>RAID is a method by which information is spread across several disks, using techniques such as disk striping (RAID Level 0), disk mirroring (RAID level 1), and striping with distributed parity (RAID Level 5), to achieve redundancy, lower latency and/or higher bandwidth for reading and/or writing to disk, and maximize recoverability from hard-disk crashes.</p> <p>The underlying concept in RAID is that data may be distributed across each drive in the array in a consistent manner. To do this, the data must first be broken into consistently-sized chunks (often 32K or 64K in size, although different sizes can be used). Each chunk is then written to each drive in turn. When the data is to be read, the process is reversed, giving the illusion that multiple drives are actually one large drive. Primary reasons to use RAID include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>enhanced transfer speed</p> </li> <li> <p>enhanced number of transactions per second</p> </li> <li> <p>increased single block device capacity</p> </li> <li> <p>greater efficiency in recovering from a single disk failure</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.204.1/#raid-levels","title":"RAID levels","text":"<p>There are a number of different ways to configure a RAID subsystem - some maximize performance, others maximize availability, while others provide a mixture of both.

Such \"paths\" might be implemented as additional network paths (preferably using their own network card) or over fibre (preferably using their own HBAs) etc. If there are multiple paths from a system to a device, a special kernel-module and associated daemons and other software will use the WWID to detect the paths. A single \"pseudo-device\" in <code>/dev/mapper/wwid</code> will be created by them, such as <code>/dev/mapper/3600508b400105df70000e00000ac0000</code>, which will give access to the device, regardless which path(s) to it there are in use, as long as at least one of them can be used ('is active').</p> <p>The command <code>multipath -l</code> shows the mapping to the non-persistent identifiers: Host:Channel:Target:LUN, <code>/dev/sd</code> name, and the major:minor number:</p> <pre><code>    3600508b400105df70000e00000ac0000 dm-2 vendor,product \n    [size=20G][features=1 queue_if_no_path][hwhandler=0][rw] \n    \\_ round-robin 0 [prio=0][active] \n    \\_ 5:0:1:1 sdc 8:32  [active][undef] \n    \\_ 6:0:1:1 sdg 8:96  [active][undef]\n    \\_ round-robin 0 [prio=0][enabled] \n    \\_ 5:0:0:1 sdb 8:16  [active][undef] \n    \\_ 6:0:0:1 sdf 8:80  [active][undef]\n</code></pre> <p>Device-mapper-multipath automatically maintains the proper mapping of each WWID-based device name to its corresponding <code>/dev/sd</code> name on the system. These names are persistent a cross path changes, and they are consistent when accessing the device from different systems. When the user_friendly_names feature (of device-mapper-multipath) is used, the WWID is mapped to a name of the form <code>/dev/mapper/mpathn</code>.

If a new device is plugged in or a device is being detached, <code>udev</code> will receive a signal from the kernel and, using a set of rules, will perform actions, for example assign an additional device name to the device.</p> <p>Before implementing LUN persistence in your system you will first need to acquire the proper WWIDs from the devices you want to control. This can be done by using the <code>scsi_id</code> program. After you required the WWIDs of your devices, you will need to write a rule so <code>udev</code> can assign a persistent name to it.</p> <p>scsi_id A minor hurdle has to be taken first. The <code>scsi_id</code> program will not list any device by default and will only list devices it has been told to see ('whitelisted' devices). To whitelist a device you will need to add its WWID to the <code>scsi_id</code> configuration file, which is <code>/etc/scsi_id.conf</code>. That's safe, but a nuisance if you want to discover WWIDs of new devices. Hence you can specify the <code>-g</code> option to allow detection of any disk that has not been listed yet. If you feel that this should be the default behaviour, you may consider editing <code>/etc/scsi_id.conf</code>. If there is a line that says:</p> <pre><code>    options=-b\n</code></pre> <p>delete it or comment it out. Then add a line that says:</p> <pre><code>    options=-g\n</code></pre> <p>If this has been configured, next time a program uses the <code>scsi_id</code> command, it will add the <code>-g</code> option (and any other options you might have specified in the configuration file) and hence allow extracting the WWIDs from new devices. The <code>-g</code> should be used either by default from the configuration file or be set manually in any <code>udev</code> rule that uses the <code>scsi_id</code> command, or else your newly plugged in device won't be recognised.</p> <p>You then will need to find out what device file your new device was allocated by the kernel. This is routinely done by using the command <code>dmesg</code> after you plugged in the new device. Typically, you will see lines similar to these:</p> <pre><code>    usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 25\n    usb 1-5: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice\n    scsi7 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices\n    usb-storage: device found at 25\n    usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning\n      Vendor: USB       Model: Flash Disk        Rev: 8.07\n      Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 04\n    SCSI device sdc: 7886848 512-byte hdwr sectors (4038 MB)\n</code></pre> <p>As you see, we plugged in a 4Gb Flash Disk that was assigned the device name 'sdc'. This device is now available as <code>/sys/block/sdc</code> in the <code>/sys</code> pseudo-filesystem, and also as a devicefile <code>/dev/sdc</code>.</p> <p>To determine the device WWID, use the <code>scsi_id</code> command:</p> <pre><code>    # scsi_id -g -u -s /block/sdc\n    3200049454505080f\n</code></pre> <p>As you see, we used the <code>-g</code> forcibly. The <code>-s</code> option specifies that you want to use the device name relative to the root of the <code>sysfs</code> filesystem (<code>/sys</code>). Newer versions of scsi_id (e.g. those in RHEL6) do not allow use of <code>sysfs</code> names anymore, so should use the device name then:</p> <pre><code>    /sbin/scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/sdc\n    3200049454505080f\n</code></pre> <p>The long string of characters in the output is the WWID. The WWID does not change when you add a new device to your system. Acquire the WWID for each device in order to create rules for the devices. To create new device rules, edit the <code>20-names.rules</code> file in the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d</code> directory. The device naming rules follow this format:</p> <pre><code>    KERNEL=\"sd&lt;?&gt;\",  BUS=\"scsi\",  PROGRAM=\"&lt;scsi_id -options..&gt;\", RESULT=\"&lt;WWID&gt;\", NAME=\"&lt;devicename&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>So, when you plug in a new device the kernel will signal <code>udev</code> it found a new SCSCI device. the PROGRAM will be executed and the RESULT should match. If so, the NAME will be used for the device file.</p> <p>An example would be:</p> <pre><code>    KERNEL=\"sd*\",  BUS=\"scsi\",  PROGRAM=\"/sbin/scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/$parent\", RESULT=\"3200049454505080f\", NAME=\"bookone\"\n</code></pre> <p>Or on RHEL6 systems:</p> <pre><code>    KERNEL=\"sd*\",  BUS=\"scsi\",  PROGRAM=\"/sbin/scsi_id -g -u -s /block/$parent\", RESULT=\"3200049454505080f\", NAME=\"bookone\"\n</code></pre> <p>When the kernel allocates a new device which name matches the KERNEL pattern, the PROGRAM is executed and when the RESULT is found the NAME is created. Note the <code>-g</code> option that we have included so we can actually see the device, though it is not whitelisted.</p> <p>The <code>udevd</code> daemon is typically started by the execution of a local startup script, normally done by the <code>init</code> process and initiated by a line in the <code>/etc/inittab</code> file. On older systems you would ensure that this line was in <code>/etc/rc.local</code>:</p> <pre><code>    /sbin/start_udev\n</code></pre> <p>On some systems, e.g. RHEL6 the line should be in <code>/etc/rc.sysinit</code>.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.204.2/#implementing-device-name-persistence-with-multipath","title":"Implementing device name persistence with multipath","text":"<p>You can implement device name persistence by using the <code>multipath</code> drivers and software.

You can turn any     consecutive number of blocks on a block device into a Physical     Volume:</li> </ul> <p>Physical Volume (PV)</p> <ul> <li>Physical Volume a physical medium with some administrative data     added to it. The command <code>pvcreate</code> can be used to add the     administration onto the physical medium. The command <code>vgcreate</code> is     used to create a volume group, which consists of one or more PV's.     A PV that has been grouped in a volume group contains Physical     Extents:</li> </ul> <p>Physical Extents (PE)</p> <ul> <li>Physical Extents Physical Extents are blocks of diskspace, often     several megabytes in size. Using the command <code>lvcreate</code> you can     assign PEs to a Logical Volume:</li> </ul> <p>Logical Volume (LV)</p> <ul> <li>Logical Volume A Logical Volume. On a logical volume we can use the     command <code>mkfs</code> to get a Filesystem:</li> </ul> <p>Filesystem</p> <ul> <li><code>ext2</code>, <code>ReiserFS</code>, <code>NWFS</code>, <code>XFS</code>, <code>JFX</code>, <code>NTFS</code> etc. mount To the     linux kernel, there is no difference between a regular partition and     a Logical Volume. A simple <code>mount</code> suffices to be able to use your     logical volume.</li> </ul> <p>lvcreate lvol Some examples of typical usage of the LVM commandset follow. Initially, you need to set the partition type for the partitions to use to create logical volumes to <code>0x8e</code>. Let's assume we have partitions <code>/dev/hda4</code> and <code>/dev/hda5</code>, and they are set to the correct partitioning type. To create a physical volume on both partitions (i.e. to set up the volume group descriptor) you type (being the superuser): pvcreate</p> <pre><code>    # pvcreate /dev/hda4 /dev/hda5\n</code></pre> <p>Now we have created two physical volumes. Next, we will create a volume group. A volume group needs to have a name (we choose <code>volume01</code>). To create our volume group, using our previously defined physical volumes, type: vgcreate</p> <pre><code>    # vgcreate volume01 /dev/hda5 /dev/hda4\n</code></pre> <p>The previous command line is the most basic form (refer to the manual pages for a list of configurable parameters). This will create an array of physical extents, by default they are 4 Mb in size. Using these extents we can create one or more logical volumes, e.g:</p> <pre><code>    # lvcreate -L 100M volume01\n</code></pre> <p>This creates a logical volume with a default name choosen by <code>lvcreate</code> and starts with the string <code>lvol</code> followed by a digit NDASH let's assume <code>lvol0</code>. The logical volume will be created using the volumegroup <code>volume01</code>. The name of the devicefile for this volume will be <code>/dev/volume01/lvol0</code>. Next, we can make a filesystem on the volumegroup, as usual, using <code>mkfs</code>, e.g. an <code>xfs</code> filesystem: mkfs mount</p> <pre><code>    # mkfs -t xfs /dev/volume01/lvol0\n</code></pre> <p>The resulting filesystem can be mounted as usual:</p> <pre><code>    # mount /dev/volume01/lvol0 /mnt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lpic2.204.3/#modifying-logical-volumes-volume-groups-and-physical-volumes","title":"Modifying logical volumes, volume groups and physical volumes","text":"<p>A logical volume can be modified in order to create more space for the filesystem that is on top of this logical volume.

To use the extra space of the logical volume the filesystem needs to be resized. This can be done by the command: xfs_grow</p> <pre><code>    # xfs_growfs /dev/volume01/lvol0\n</code></pre> <p>For an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system use the command <code>resize2fs</code>.

To do so the logical volume manager first reads the (unchanged) data block on the original and than writes the data block to the snapshot.

It initially developed a set of standards by which memory could be added to portable systems. The PCMCIA specification 2.0 release in 1991 added protocols for I/O devices and hard disks. The 2.1 release in 1993 refined these specifications, and is the standard around which PCMCIA cards are built today. PCMCIA cards are credit card size adapters which fit into PCMCIA slots. There are three types of PCMCIA cards, Type I generally used for memory cards such as FLASH and STATIC RAM; Type II used for I/O peripherals Type II Type I Type III such as serial adapters and fax-modems and Type III which are used for rotating media such as hard disks.

To make the interface netmask recognize this, the <code>ifconfig</code> invocation would look like this:</p> <pre><code>    # ifconfig eth0 172.16.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0\n</code></pre> <p>This command assigns the eth0 interface an IP address of 172.16.1.2.

Also, the maximum transmission unit (the maximum size of IP datagrams the MTU kernel will generate for this interface) has been set to the maximum size of Ethernet packets: 1,500 bytes.

Assuming that romeo has already been configured, we just have to add an entry to the routing table telling the kernel all hosts on the other network can be reached through romeo.

One of these gateways can be seen as 'the one on the left', the other as 'the one on the right'. Hence specifications are written in terms of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> participants. There is no special meaning attached to either name, they are just labels - you might have defined the 'left' host to be the 'right' host and vice versa.</p> <p>Normally, you would use the exact same configuration file on both sides. Interpretation of that file is done by checking the local configuration. For example if it was stated in the configuration file that the IP address for 'left' is 1.2.3.4, the software assumes that it runs on the left node if it finds that IP address configured on one of its network devices. The same file is interpreted differently on the other node, as that hosts configuration differs.</p> <p>The <code>left</code>, <code>leftsubnet</code> and <code>leftnexthop</code> (and the <code>right...</code> counterparts) determine the layout of the connection:</p> <p></p> <p>The <code>leftid</code> and <code>leftrsasigkey</code> are used in authenticating the left participant. The <code>leftrsasigkey</code> is the public key of the left participant (in the example above the RSA keys are shortened for easy display). The private key is stored in the <code>/etc/ipsec.secrets</code> file and should be kept secure.</p> <p>The keys can be generated on both client and server with the command:</p> <pre><code>    # ipsec rsasigkey --verbose 2048 &gt; rsa.key\n</code></pre> <p>The IKE-daemon of IPSEC is called <code>pluto</code>.

If the network part of the address is incorrect, every <code>ping</code> will fail with the \"no answer\" ping error; because the IP address is unfamiliar to the other hosts on the network, return packets will be directed to their default gateway (often leading to the internet) or even dropped. In this case, using <code>ifconfig</code> may reveal the incorrect address. However, if the host part of the address is wrong, the problem can be more difficult to detect. A small system, such as a PC that only connects out to other systems and never accepts incoming connections, can run for a long time with the wrong address without its user noticing the problem. Additionally, the system that suffers the ill effects may not be the one that is misconfigured. It is possible for someone to accidentally use your IP address on his own system and for his mistake to cause intermittent communication problems to your system. This type of configuration error cannot be discovered by <code>ifconfig</code>, because the error is on a remote host. IP conflicts like this can be discovered using the <code>arp</code> command, which will show two alternating MAC addresses for the same IP address. arp</p> <p>The <code>ifconfig</code> command can be used to set up multihomed network device.

Path discovery is an essential step in diagnosing routing problems. Note that <code>traceroute6</code> is equivalent to <code>traceroute -6</code></p> <p>The <code>traceroute</code> command is based on a clever use of the Time-To-Live (TTL) field in the IP packet's TTL header. The TTL field is used to limit the lifetime of a packet. When a router fails or is misconfigured, a routing loop or circular path may result. The TTL field prevents packets from remaining on a network indefinitely should such a routing loop occur. A packet's TTL field is decremented each time the packet crosses a router on its way through a network. When its value reaches 0, the packet is discarded rather than forwarded. When discarded, an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED TIME_EXCEEDED message is sent back to the packet's source to inform the source that the packet was discarded. By manipulating the TTL field of the original packet, the program <code>traceroute</code> uses information from these ICMP messages to discover paths through a network.</p> <p><code>traceroute</code> sends a series of UDP packets with the destination address of the device you want a path to. By default, <code>traceroute</code> sends sets of three packets to discover each hop. traceroute sets the TTL field in the first three packets to a value of 1 so that they are discarded by the first router on the path. When the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED messages are returned by that router, <code>traceroute</code> records the source IP address of these ICMP messages. This is the IP address of the first hop on the route to the destination.</p> <p>Next, three packets are sent with their TTL field set to 2. These will be discarded by the second router on the path. The ICMP messages returned by this router reveal the IP address of the second router on the path. The program proceeds in this manner until a set of packets finally has a TTL value large enough so that the packets reach their destination.

In olden days most system administrators simply backed up as much as possible - that may not be such a good idea anymore as it takes a lot of time to backup and restore large quantities of data. In all situations you do not need to backup certain parts of the Linux filesystem anyway, for example the <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> filesystems. They only contain data that the kernel generates automatically, it is never a good idea to back it up. The <code>/proc/kcore</code> file is especially unnecessary, since it is just an image of your current physical memory; it's pretty large as well. Some special files that are constantly changed by the operating system (e.g. <code>/etc/mtab</code>) should not be restored, hence not be backed up. There may be others on your system.</p> <p>Gray areas include the news spool, log files and many other things in <code>/var</code>. You must decide what you consider important - do a proper risk analysis. Also, consider what to do with the device files in <code>/dev</code>. Most backup solutions can backup and restore these special files, but you may want to re-generate them with a script or they may be created when you reinstall a system.</p> <p>The obvious things to back up are user files (<code>/home</code>) and system configuration files (<code>/etc</code>, but possibly other things scattered all over the filesystem).</p> <p>Generally it is a good idea to backup everything needed to rebuild the system as fast as required after a failure - and nothing else.

So, the only time when a backup is necessary, for example, is when the system is updated or after a security update.</p> <p>To determine your minimal backup frequency consider the amount of data you are confident you can afford to loose without severe consequences for you and/or your company. Then consider the minimal timespan needed to create that amount of data. You should make at least one backup during that timespan. Practical considerations like the time it takes to make a backup and whether or not you can do any work when a backup is being made, will restrict the maximum frequency. In the past systems were mainly used during the day and not at all in weekends. Hence many companies made incremental backups during the night and a full backup during the weekend. However, nowadays many systems need to be used 24 x 7 which creates the need for alternate strategies, for example creating snapshots on disk, which can subsequently be backed up on tape while the production systems continue their work on the live filesystem.</p> <p>Backups can take several hours to complete, but, for a successful backup strategy, human interaction should be minimal. Backups are mostly made to disk or on tape. In the latter case, the human interaction can be further reduced by having tape robots that change the tapes for you.

Bandwidth can be high if data is provides/requisted in a continuous stream. Tape is especially suitable for long term backup and archiving.

This file was then distributed by FTP to other Internet connected hosts.</p> <p>Due to the vast amount of hosts being connected to the Internet over time, another name resolving system was developed known as Domain Names. This system incorporated design goals like distributed updates and local caching, to increase resolving performance. Because of these features, every nameserver needs to be specifically configured for it's purpose. The following terms are apparent when configuring nameserver software like BIND:</p> <p>Zones are the equivalent of domains. Zone configuration files consist of hostnames and IP address information. Nameserver software responds to requests on port <code>53</code>, and translates DNS (host- or domain-)names to IP addresses. It can also translate IP addresses into DNS names, this is called a \"reverse DNS lookup\" (rDNS). In order for rDNS to work, a so called pointer DNS record (PTR record) has to exist for the host being queried.</p> <p>We distinguish authoritive nameservers, recursive nameservers and so called resolvers. The authoritive nameserver for a zone is the nameserver which administrates the zone configuration. It is therefore sometimes also referred to as the zone master. A recursive nameserver is a nameserver that resolves zones for which it is not authoritive for at other nameservers. The resolver is the part of the nameserver and DNS client software which performs the actual queries. In general, these are libraries as part of DNS software.</p> <p>Table Major BIND components lists the most relevant parts of BIND software on a system.

Using a key and some algorithm a cleartext message is scrambled into something incomprehensible. To restore the message, you need the same key. This works fine to shield a message from prying eyes, but it is not usable to prove that a message was sent by a given party. Either party could write a message, encrypt it with the private key and say it was the other party that wrote the message. There is no way you can tell if this is actually true.</p> <p>The related concept of asymmetrical encryption also allows enciphering and deciphering of messages. But instead of one shared key there are two separate but related ones: one is used to encipher a message, the other to decipher it. After generating such a key pair the owner hands out only one of these keys to the other party or parties, the public key. The other half of the key pair is kept secret (the private key). Whomever has access to the public key can use it to encrypt a message. The owner of the corresponding private key will be the only person that can decipher it. Hence the sender can be sure that he alone can read the message. Moreover he can send an encrypted message, using the private key to encipher it. Everyone with access to the public key will be able decipher it, and can be sure that it really was the owner of the corresponding private key that sent the message.</p> <p>Either private, public, or symmetric keys may be used to compute a MAC (Message Authentication Code). The algorithm to compute a MAC uses two inputs: the key and the message. The output is a fixed length string of hexadecimal digits. The MAC is computed using the key (or half of a key pair) and both the MAC and the message are subsequently sent. The receiving party will also use the message to calculate the MAC with the shared key or the other half of the key pair. If both hashes match there is a very high certainty the message has not been altered and that it originates from the sender. Note that when you use a MAC the message itself will not be encrypted, it can be read by anybody.</p> <p>DNSSEC signs its messages with a MAC. It uses a private key that is only known to DNSSEC. The corresponding public key is published on the nameservers of the next level zone. It can be obtained by querying the parent domain nameservers (the 'trust anchor'). So the public key for example of the <code>sidn.nl</code> domain will be available on the 'nl' nameservers. The public key itself in turn will be signed using a private key whose public key will be available on the next level above. So for the domain a.b.c the public keys of \"a\" can be found on the zone server for \"b\". The public keys are signed with the private key whose public key is published on the nameservers of \"c\" (You may want to read that sentence again ;-) ).</p> <p>Eventually the verification chain ends at the root servers. To obtain the keys used to sign the top level domains the <code>dig</code> could be used but of course, the query might be also be spoofed. Therefore serious validating resolvers obtain the keys by other means. For instance by retrieving them from a signed software package, similarly to the built-in SSL root certificates in browsers.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.207.3/#using-the-dnssec-keygen-command","title":"Using the <code>dnssec-keygen</code> command","text":"<p>According to the lpic2 objective you must be able to use BIND 9's <code>dnssec-keygen</code>.</p> <p>Note The <code>dnssec-keygen</code> command is part of the DNSSEC security extension for DNS (fully described in ???).</p> <p>DNSSEC was not fully implemented in BIND versions older than 9.2.</p> <p>The 13 authoritive root servers use DNSSEC since May 6<sup>th</sup> 2010.</p> <p>The <code>dnssec-keygen</code> may be used to generate public/private and symmetric keys.

NSEC records were invented to solve a problem: if you queried a secured nameserver (one that signs the results of a query) and you would ask for a non-existing name, it would simply return - nothing. As you can't sign 'nothing' you would never know if the anwer you got - nothing - really is what you should have gotten. Hence NSEC records. A NSEC record (Next SECure) states a range of names that do not exist. As NSEC records can be signed the answer can be trusted again.</p> <p>An Example of an NSEC record for the dnssec-tools.org domain:</p> <pre><code>    adonis.zonetransfer.me.       10800   IN      NSEC   helena.zonetransfer.me.\n</code></pre> <p>The record specifies that no DNS records exist between <code>adonis.zonetransfer.me.</code> and <code>helena.zonetransfer.me.</code>, which would exclude <code>brutus.zonetransfer.me.</code> from being an existing and therefore valid domain.</p> <p>Use of NSEC records solves one problem, but introduces the next: it allows easy retrieval of all zone data by simply asking for a random name. This works because NSEC records assume alphabetical ordering of domain names. An example: if you would request 'a.example.com' and the answer would be 'do not have it, but the next valid record is joe.example.com', you know that joe.example.com exists and nothing before it does. So, then you might try jof.example.com, as 'f' is the next letter in the alphabet, etc. A solution to solve this problem is the NSEC3 record. The NSEC3 record is actually a NSEC record too but it will not return the next name, but the hash of the next name. If you ask for a.example.com you will get a record that says 'not here, and this is the hash of the next valid domain name'. There are no known methods - other than brute force - to find a name that matches that hash. If you already know the next valid domain name, you can calculate its hash and verify the answer. If you do not, the data will not help you to find out.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.207.3/#dane","title":"DANE","text":"<p>After having set up DNSSEC for a certain domain, it is possible to make use of DNS Authenticated Named Entities: DANE. In order to understand the advantage of DANE, we need to look at the problem DANE is trying to address. And this problem involves Certificate Authorities, or CA's in short.</p> <p>The problem with CA-dependant encryption solutions lies in the implementation. When visiting a SSL/TLS Encrypted website via HTTPS, the browser software will gladly accept ANY certificate that uses a matching CN value AND is considered as being issued by a valid Certificate Authority. The CN value is dependent on DNS, and luckily we just set up DNSSEC to have some assurence regarding that. But, modern browsers come with over 1000 trusted root certificates. Every certificate being presented to the browser by a webserver, will be validated using these root certificates. If the presented certificate can be correlated to one of the root certificates, the science matches and the browser will not complain. And that's a problem.</p> <p>In a perfect world, this system could provide some assurance. Unfortunately, every chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. Many known attack vectors exist in regards to integrity and confidentiality of HTTPS sessions. The Certificate Authorities are in a league of their own though. Just as every CA needs to be in control of their security 100% of the time, an attacker only needs one moment one CA is not. If an attacker gets hold of one of the keys used to sign certificates, it is Game Over[tm]. This has happened in the past, and there is no assurence it will not happen again in the future.</p> <p>The problem consists of browsers accepting any valid certificate for any domain. And lack of control about exactly which certificates are valid for exactly what domain. There are a couple of workarounds out there like Certificate Transparency and Certificate Pinning. But for now, these remain to be workarounds for a flawed system. After all, the problem is not limited to your Desktop. The provided trust in CA-issued certificates becomes a problem when that CA cannot be trusted anymore. This has happened.</p> <p>The infamous \"Black Tulip\" case describes a breach that has occured at a Dutch CA called DigiNotar. Attackers gained access to systems and generated fake certificates for major websites. Except, these certificates were not recognized as fake since they had been generated by a trusted CA. The certificate chain could be backtraced to DigiNotar and seemed valid. Despite DigiNotar never having received the order or permission to generate certificates for the affected domains. After it was discovered that attackers had issued multiple DigiNotar certificates, the trust in DigiNotar as a CA could not be maintained. The affected CA root certificate was removed from the list of trusted certificates by many software vendors. DigiNotar filed for bankcrupcy within weeks.</p> <p>If that already sounds bad, consider the total impact of this data breach. Because certificates issued by DigiNotar were blacklisted as a result, software depending on valid certificates could no longer function properly. This had real-world consequences, since DigiNotar also issued certificates to government and trading related customers. The tulips could not be shipped and went black, so to say. For this reason, some large corporations that depend on their online presence for core business get their certificates from more than one CA. This way, if one CA gets compromised and all related certificates have to be revoked, that will not be a Single Point Of Failure to the business. Good for the business, not good for transparency in regards to certificates.</p> <p>This is where DANE comes in; While depending on the assurance provided by DNSSEC, DNS records are provided with certificate associating information. This mitigates the dependency regarding static root certificates for certain types of SSL/TLS connections. These records have come to be known as TLSA records. As with HTTPS, DANE should be implemented either correctly or better yet not at all. When implemented correctly, DANE will provide added integrity regarding the certificates being used for encryption. By doing so, the confidentiality aspect of the session gets a boost as well.</p> <p>The TLSA Resource Record syntax is described in RFC 6698 sections 2 and 7. An example of a SHA-256 hashed association of a PKIX CA Certificate taken from RFC 6698 looks as follows:</p> <pre><code>    _443._tcp.www.example.com. IN TLSA (\n          0 0 1 d2abde240d7cd3ee6b4b28c54df034b9\n                7983a1d16e8a410e4561cb106618e971 )\n</code></pre> <p>Each TLSA Resource Record (RR) specifies the following fields in order to create the certificate association: Certificate Usage, Selector, Matching Type and Certificate Association Data. The Certificate Association Data Field in the example above is represented by the SHA-256 hash string value. The contents of this Data Field are dependent on the values preceeding from the previous three RR fields. These three fields are represented by <code>'0 0 1'</code> in the example above. We will explain these fields in reverse order. This makes sense if you look at the hash value and then read the values from right to left as <code>'1 0 0'</code>.</p> <p>The value <code>'1'</code> in the third field from the example above represents the Matching Type field. This field can have a value between <code>'0'</code> and <code>'2'</code>. It specifies whether the Certification Association Data field contents are NOT hashed (value <code>0</code>), hashed using SHA-256 (value <code>1</code>) or hashed using SHA-512 (value <code>2</code>). In the example above, the contents of the Certificate Association Data field represent a SHA-256 hash string.</p> <p>The second field represented by a <code>'0'</code> represents the Selector Field. The TLSA Selectors are represented by either a <code>'0'</code> or a <code>'1'</code>. A field value of <code>'0'</code> indicates that the Certificate Association Data field contents are based on a full certificate. A value of <code>'1'</code> indicates that the contents of the Certificate Association Data Field are based on the Public Key of a certificate. In the example above, the Selector field indicates that the SHA-256 hash string from the Certificate Association Data field is based on a full certificate.</p> <p>The first field represented by a '0' in the example above represents the Certificate Usage field. This field may hold a value between '0' and '3'. A value of <code>'0'</code> (PKIX-TA) specifies that the Certificate Association Data field value is related to a public Certificate Authority from the X.509 tree. A value of <code>'1'</code> (PKIX-EE) specifies that the Certificate Association Data field value is related to the certificate on the endpoint you are connecting to, using X.509 validation. A value of <code>'2'</code> (DANE-TA) specifies that the Certificate Association Data field value is related to a private CA from the X.509 tree. And a value of <code>'3'</code> (DANE-EE) specifies that the Certificate Association Data field value is related to the certificate on the endpoint you are connecting to. In the example above, the Certificate Usage field indicates that the certificate the SHA-256 string is based on belongs to a public Certificate Authority from the X.509 tree. Those are the same Certificate authorities that your browser uses. Field values of <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code> or <code>'2'</code> still depend on these CA root certificates. The true benefit of TLSA records gets unleashed when DNSSEC is properly configured and using a value of <code>'3'</code> as a value for the Certificate Usage Field.</p> <p>Looking back at the very start of the TLSA Resource Record example above, the syntax clearly follows the <code>_port._protocol.subject</code> syntax. The TLSA Resource Record always starts with an underscore '_'. Then the service port is defined (443 for HTTPS) and a transport protocol is specified. This can be either tcp, udp, or sctp according to RFC 6698. When generating TLSA records, it is also possible to specify dccp as a transport protocol. RFC 6698 does not explicitly mention dccp though. The subject field usually equals the servername and should match the CN value of the certificate.</p> <p>It is not mandatory for the LPIC-2 exam to know all these details by heart. But, it is good to have an understanding about the different options and their impact. Just as using a value of <code>'3'</code> as the Certificate Usage can have some security advantages, a value of <code>'0'</code> as the Matching Type field can result in fragmented DNS replies when complete certificates end up in TLSA Resource Records. The success of security comes with usability.</p> <p>To generate your own TLSA records, a page like the following can be used and should provide some insight in to the used parameters and values: www.huque.com/bin/gen_tlsa</p> <p>As much as the previously mentioned website is suitable for creating occasional TLSA records, there are circumstances when custom tooling is more appropriate. The <code>hashslinger</code> command-line tool has been developed to ease the creation of TLSA records.</p> <p>When implemented correctly and supported widely, DANE has the potential to secure certificate based encryption for a variety of services.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.207.3/#internal-dns","title":"Internal DNS","text":"<p>If your organization uses TCP/IP on its internal networks NDASH a very common situation nowadays NDASH they will also need a method to locally resolve hostnames into IP addresses and vice versa.

Nowadays Apache is available in binary format for most modern (post 2005) Linux distributions. Installing programs from source is already covered in 206.1. Therefore, we will concentrate on working with rpm and apt package managers and tools during this chapter. Do not underestimate the importance of building Apache from source though. Depending on requirements and (lack of) availability, it might still be necessary to compile Apache and Apache modules from source. The Apache binary <code>httpd</code> can be invoked with certain command-line options that affect the behaviour of the server. But in general Apache is started by other scripts that serve as a wrapper for <code>httpd</code>. These scripts should take care of passing required flags to <code>httpd</code>. The behaviour of the server is configured by setting various options called <code>directives</code>. These <code>directives</code> are declared in configuration files. The location of configuration files and how they are organized varies. Red Hat and similar distributions have their configuration files in the <code>/etc/httpd/conf</code> directory. Other locations which are or have been used are <code>/etc/apache/config</code>, <code>/etc/httpd/config</code> and <code>/etc/apache2</code>.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution and enabled repositories, your distribution may come with Apache 2.2 or Apache 2.4 or both. Apache 2.0 does comply to the LPIC-2 Apache 2.x scope due to its name, but Apache 2.0 is no longer maintained. It is therefore not recommended to use Apache 2.0. Instead, Apache 2.4 is recommended to be used by the Apache foundation. As a Linux administrator, you may however still encounter Apache 2.0 on servers. It is therefore recommended to familiarize yourself with the configuration differences between the different versions. The Apache foundation does provide guidence: Via https://httpd.apache.org/docs/ upgrade documents can be accessed that address the necessary steps when upgrading from Apache 2.0 to 2.2, and from Apache 2.2 to 2.4.</p> <p>It is important to distinguish between (global) directives that affect the Apache server processes, and options that affect a specific component of the Apache server, i.e. an option that only affects a specific website. The way the configuration files are layed out can often be a clue as to where which settings are configured. Despite this presumed obviousness, it is also important not to make assumptions. Always familiarize yourself with all the configured options. When in doubt about a specific option, use the documentation or a web search to find out more and consider whether the option is configured appropriately.</p> <p>On many (Red Hat based) distributions the main Apache configuration file is <code>httpd.conf</code>, other (Debian based) distributions favour the <code>apache2.conf</code> filename. Depending on your distribution and installation it might be one big file or a small generic one with references to other configuration files via <code>Include</code> and/or <code>IncludeOptional</code> statements. The difference between these two directives lies in the optional part. If Apache is configured to <code>Include</code> all <code>*.conf</code> files from a certain directory, there has to be at least one file that matches that pattern to include. Otherwise, the Apache server will fail to start. As an alternative, the <code>IncludeOptional</code> directive can be used to include configuration files if they are present and accessible. The Apache main configuration file can configure generic settings like servername, listening port(s) and which IP addresses these ports should be bound to. There may also be a seperate <code>ports.conf</code> configuration file though, so always follow the <code>Include</code> directives and familiarize yourself with the contents of all configuration files. The user and group Apache should run as can also be configured from the main configuration file. These accounts can be set to switch after startup. This way, the Apache software can be started as the root user, but then switch to a dedicated \"www\", \"httpd\" or \"apache\" user to adhere to the principle of least privilege. There are also various directives to influence the way Apache serves files from its document tree. For example there are <code>Directory</code> directives that control whether it is allowed to execute PHP files located in them. The default configuration file is meant to be self explanatory and contains a lot of valuable information. In regards to the LPIC-2 exam, you are required to be familiar with the most common Apache directives. We shall cover some of those in the section to come. At the time of this writing, Apache 2.4 is the latest stable version and the recommended version to use according to it's distributor, the Apache Foundation. Where applicable, this book will try to point out the differences between the various versions.</p> <p>An additional method to set options for a subdivision of the document tree is by means of an <code>.htaccess</code> file. For security reasons you will also need to enable the use of <code>.htaccess</code> files in the main configuration file by setting the <code>AllowOverride</code> directive for that <code>Directory</code> context. All options in an <code>.htaccess</code> file influence files in the directory and the ones below it, unless they are overridden by another <code>.htaccess</code> file or directives in the main configuration file.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.1/#modularity","title":"Modularity","text":"<p>Apache has a modular source code architecture. You can custom build a server with only modules you really want. Many modules are available on the Internet and you could also write your own.</p> <p>Modules are compiled objects written in C.

These modules include an API to allow for modules written in an interpreted (scripted) language.</p> <p>The modular structure of Apache's source code should not be confused with the functionality of run-time loading of Apache modules. Run-time modules are loaded after the core functionality of Apache has started and are a relatively new feature. In older versions, to use the functionality of a module, it needed to be compiled in during the build phase. Current implementations of Apache are capable of run-time module loading.

This is a way to load a Dynamic Shared Objects special program into the address space of an executable at run-time.

By convention the extension <code>.so</code> is used. These files are usually installed in a program-specific directory.

Always check for the existence of a <code>LoadModule</code> line in one of the configuration files:</p> <pre><code>    LoadModule apache_ssl_module modules/libssl.so\n</code></pre> <p>This line might belong in the Apache main configuration file, or one of the included configuration files. A construction that has been receiving much support lately, is the use of seperate <code>modules-available</code> and <code>modules-enabled</code> directories. These directories are subdirectories inside the Apache configuration directory. Modules are installed in the <code>modules-available</code> directory, and an <code>Include</code> reference is made to a symbolic link inside the <code>modules-enabled</code> directory. This symbolic link then points back to the module. The <code>Include</code> reference might be a wildcard, including all files from a certain directory.</p> <p>Another construction is similar, but includes a <code>conf.modules.d</code> directory inside the Apache configuration directory. This file is in fact a symbolic link, pointing to a directory inside the Apache program directory somewhere else on the filesystem. An example from a Red Hat based host:</p> <pre><code>    Include conf.modules.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Again, the implementations you could encounter might differ significantly from each other. Various aspects such as Linux distribution used, Apache version installed or whether Apache is installed from packages or source may be of influence to the way Apache is implemented.

It will often contain details of what went wrong and how to fix it.</p> <p>The error log is usually written to a file (typically error_log on Unix systems and error.log on Windows). On Unix systems it is also possible to have the server send errors to syslog or pipe them to a program.</p> <p>The format of the error log is relatively free-form and descriptive. But there is certain information that is contained in most error log entries.

The <code>LogLevel</code> directive is used to control the types of errors that are sent to the error log by restricting the severity level. The third item gives the IP address of the client that generated the error. Beyond that is the message itself, which in this case indicates that the server has been configured to deny the client access. The server reports the file-system path (as opposed to the web path) of the requested document.</p> <p>A very wide variety of different messages can appear in the error log.

On Unix systems, you can accomplish this using:</p> <pre><code>    tail -f error_log\n</code></pre> <p>Knowing how to customize Apache logging may prove to be a very usable skill. Manually reviewing Apache logs is not for the faint of heart. For a low-traffic server, this may still be doable. Otherwise, looking for information by sifting through logs on a busy server that serves multiple websites, can become a very intense textfile-manipulating-excercise. This creates a paradox: With little to no logging, hardly any input is available when looking for the cause of a problem. With very elaborate logging in place, the information may be overwhelming. For this reason, Apache logs are often interpreted by external facilities. The logs are either sent to or read by a system that has the capability to visualize statistics and recognize patterns. To ensure the provided logging is adequate, customizing the Apache logging first may be necessary.</p> <p>Apache 2.3.6 and later provide the possibility to enable different kinds of <code>LogLevel</code> configurations on a per-module or per-directory basis.

First of all, the difference between authentication and authorization should be clear. Authentication is the process in which a user should validate their identity. This is the who part. Authorization is the process of deciding who is allowed to do what. Authorization either allows or denies requests made to the Apache server. Authorization depends on authentication to make these decisions.</p> <p>The Apache modules that serve the purpose of autheNtication, follow the naming convention of <code>mod_authn_*</code>. The modules that serve the purpose of authoriZation, follow the convention of <code>mod_authz_*</code>. An exception to this rule is the <code>mod_authnz_ldap</code> module. As you might have guessed, due to the nature of LDAP this module can aid in both authentication as well as authorization.</p> <p>The location of these modules on the filesystem may vary. Most distributions create a <code>modules</code>, <code>modules.d</code> or <code>modules-available</code> directory within the Apache configuration directory. This directory can very well be a symbolic link to a directory somewhere else on the filesystem. This can be determined by invoking <code>pwd -P</code> or <code>ls -ld</code> from within the modules directory as shown by the following example:</p> <pre><code>    [user@redhatbased /etc/httpd]$ pwd -P\n    /usr/lib64/httpd/modules\n</code></pre> <p>In the example above, the symbolic link <code>/etc/httpd/modules</code> provides for easy reference to the modules from within Apache configuration files. Apache modules are loaded using the <code>LoadModule</code> directive. This directive expects the path to the module to be relative to the Apache configuration directory declared by the <code>ServerRoot</code> directive.</p> <p>In general, modules will use some form of database to store and retrieve credential data. The <code>mod_authn_file</code> module for instance uses text files where <code>mod_auth_dbm</code> employs a Unix DBM database.</p> <p>Below is a list of some modules that are included as part of the standard Apache distribution.</p> <p><code>mod_auth_file</code></p> <ul> <li>(DAC) This is the basis for most Apache security modules; it uses     ordinary text files for the authentication database.</li> </ul> <p><code>mod_access</code></p> <ul> <li>(MAC) This used to be the only module in the standard Apache     distribution which applies what Apache defines as     mandatory controls. It used to allow you to list hosts, domains,     and/or IP addresses or networks that were permitted or denied access     to documents. As of Apache 2.4, this module is no longer used.     Apache 2.4 and newer use an updated authentication and authorization     model. This new model also comes with new modules, new directives     and new syntax. The <code>mod_access</code> module is still an LPIC-2 exam     objective, so the pre-2.4 syntax should still be familiar to you. In     order to aid the migration towards Apache 2.4, a module called     <code>mod_access_compat</code> ships with Apache 2.4. This module serves the     purpose of still accepting the pre-2.4 syntax on Apache 2.4 servers.     If you encounter <code>mod_access</code> related errors after upgrading to     Apache 2.4 from a previous version, make sure the Apache 2.4     configuration loads this compabibility module with a line similar     to:<pre><code>LoadModule mod_access_compat modules/mod_access_compat.so\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p><code>mod_authn_anon</code></p> <ul> <li>(DAC) This module mimics the behaviour of anonymous FTP. Rather than     having a Apachemod_auth_anon database of valid credentials, it     recognizes a list of valid usernames (i.e., the way an FTP server     recognizes \"ftp\" and \"anonymous\") and grants access to any of those     with virtually any password. This module is more useful for logging     access to resources and keeping robots out than it is for actual     access control.</li> </ul> <p><code>mod_authn_dbm</code></p> <ul> <li>(DAC) Like <code>mod_auth_db</code>, except that credentials are stored in a     Unix DBM file.</li> </ul> <p><code>mod_auth_digest</code></p> <ul> <li> <p>(DAC) This module implements HTTP Digest Authentication (RFC2617),     Apachemod_auth_digest which used to provide a more secure     alternative to the <code>mod_auth_basic</code> functionality. The explanation     that follows is nice to know but outdated. The whole point of digest     authentication was to prevent user credentials to travel via     unencrypted HTTP over the wire. The hashing algorithms used by the     digest module are however seriously outdated. Using digest     authentication instead of basic HTTP authentication does not offer     as many advantages in terms of security as the use of HTTPS would.     The following documentation page provides more detail:     http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_digest.html.</p> <p>After receiving a request and a user name, the server will challenge the client by sending a <code>nonce</code>. The contents of a nonce can be any (preferably base 64 encoded) string, and the server may use the nonce to prevent replay attacks. A nonce might, for example, be constructed using an encrypted timestamp within a resolution of a minute, i.e. '201611291619'. The timestamp (and maybe other static data identifying the requested URI) might be encrypted using a private key known only to the server.</p> <p>Upon receival of the nonce the client calculates a hash (by default a MD5 checksum) of the received nonce, the username, the password, the HTTP method, and the requested URI and sends the result back to the server. The server will gather the same data from session data and password data retrieved from a local digest database. To reconstruct the nonce the server will try twice: the first try will use the current clocktime, the second try (if necessary) will use the current clocktime minus one minute. One of the tries should give the exact same hash the client calculated. If so, access to the page will be granted. This restricts validity of the challenge to one minute and prevents replay attacks.</p> <p>Please note that the contents of the nonce can be chosen by the server at will. The example provided is one of many possibilities. Like with <code>mod_auth</code>, the credentials are stored in a text file (the digest database). Digest database files are managed with the <code>htdigest</code> tool. Please refer to the module documentation for more details.</p> </li> </ul> <p><code>mod_authz_host</code></p> <ul> <li>The <code>mod_authz_host</code> module may be used to <code>Require</code> a certain     source of request towards Apache. The <code>mod_authz_host</code> module is     quite flexible about the arguments provided. Due to the name of the     module, it may seem logical to provide a hostname. While this     certainly works, it may not be the preferred choice. Not only does     this module need to perform a forward DNS lookup on the provided     hostname to resolve it to a numerical IP, the module is also     configured to perform a reverse DNS lookup on the resolved numerical     IP after the forward lookup is performed. Providing a hostname thus     leads to at least two DNS lookups for every affected webserver     request. And if the reverse DNS result differs from the provided     hostname, the request will be denied despite what the configuration     may allow. To circumvent this requirement regarding forward and     reverse DNS records matching, the <code>forward-dns</code> option may be used     when providing a hostname. Luckily, <code>mod_authz_host</code> not only     accepts hostnames as an argument. It can also handle (partial) IP     addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, and CIDR style notations. There is     also an argument available called <code>local</code>. This will translate to     the <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> or <code>::1</code> loopback addresses as well as the     configured IP addresses of the server. This setting may come in     handy when restricting connections in regards to the local host.     Because of the liberal way that IP addresses are interpreted, it is     recommended to be as explicit as possible when using this module.     For instance, all of the following is regarded as valid input and     will be interpreted by the rules that apply:<pre><code> Require host: sue.nl\n Require ip: 10.6.6\n Require ip: 172\n Require ip: 10.9.9.9/32\n Require forward-dns: cloudhost.sue.nl\n Require local\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>One of the noteworthy differences between Apache 2.2 and 2.4 lies in the directives used for authorization. The authorization functionality is provided by Apache <code>mod_authz_*</code> modules. Where previous versions of Apache used the <code>Order</code>, <code>Allow from</code>, <code>Deny from</code> and <code>Satisfy</code> directives, Apache 2.4 uses new directives called <code>all</code>, <code>env</code>, <code>host</code> and <code>ip</code>. These new directives have a significant impact on the syntax of configuration files. In order to aid the transition towards Apache 2.4, the <code>mod_access_compat</code> module can still interpret the previously used authorization directives. This module has to be explicitly enabled though. In doing so, backwards compatibility towards previous authorization configuration directives is maintained. The current authorization directives provide the possibility of a more granular configuration in regards to who is authorized to do what. This added granularity mostly comes from the availability of the <code>Require</code> directive. This directive could already be used before Apache 2.4 for authentication purposes. Since Apache 2.4 though, this directive can also be interpreted by the authorization modules.</p> <p>The following example puts the old en new syntax in comparison, while providing the same functionality.</p> <p>First, the pre-2.4 style:</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Directory /lpic2bookdev&gt;\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n    allow from 10.6.6.0/24\n    Require group employees\n    Satisfy any\n    &lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>And now the same codeblock, but using the Apache 2.4 style syntax:</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Directory /lpic2bookdev&gt;\n    &lt;RequireAny&gt;\n    Require ip 10.6.6.0/24\n    Require group employees\n    &lt;/RequireAny&gt;\n    &lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The benefit of the new syntax is all about efficiency. By accomplishing the same functionality with fewer lines, the processing of those lines will be handled more effectively by both humans and computers. The computers benefit from spending less processing cycles while accomplishing the same result. Humans benefit from a short configuration section. Long configurations are more prone to contain errors that may be overlooked. By creating sections within configuration files using the <code>RequireAll</code>, <code>RequireAny</code>, and <code>RequireNone</code> directives, these configurations can contain granular rules while at the same time preserving their readability.</p> <p>Another 2.4 change that is worth mentioning, has to do with the LPIC-2 exam objective regarding the <code>mod_auth</code> module. Starting with Apache 2.1, the functionality of the <code>mod_auth</code> module has been superseeded by more specific modules. One of these modules, <code>mod_authn_file</code> now provides the functionality that was previously offered by <code>mod_auth</code>. <code>mod_authn_file</code> allows for the use of a file that holds usernames and password as part of the authorization process. This file can be created and the contents may be maintained by the <code>htpasswd</code> utility. When using <code>mod_auth_digest</code> instead of <code>mod_auth_basic</code>, the <code>htdigest</code> utility should be used instead. This book will focus on the <code>mod_auth_basic</code> option. The <code>htpasswd -c</code> option will create a file with the provided argument as a filename during creation of a username and password pair. <code>htpasswd</code> allows for the creation of crypt, MD5 or SHA1 password algorithms. As of Apache 2.4.4, it is also possible to use bcrypt as the password encryption algorithm. Plaintext passwords can also be generated using the <code>htpasswd -p</code> option, but will only work if Apache 2.4 is hosted on Netware and MS Windows platforms. The crypt algorithm used to be the <code>htpasswd</code> default algorithm up to Apache version 2.2.17, but is considered insecure. Crypt will limit the provided password to the first eight characters. Every part of the password string from the ninth character on will be neglected. Crypt password strings are subject to fast brute force cracking and therefore pose a considerable security risk. The use of the crypt algorithm should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, the bcrypt algorithm should be considered when available. On a system with Apache 2.4.4 or later, the following syntax can be used to create a new password file <code>htpasswdfile</code>, supply it with the user \"bob\" and set the password for the user account using the bcrypt algorithm:</p> <pre><code>    htpasswd -cB /path/outside/document/root/htpasswdfile bob\n</code></pre> <p>The system will ask for the new password twice. To update this file anytime later by adding the user \"alice\", the <code>-c</code> option can be ommited to prevent the file from being rewritten:</p> <pre><code>    htpasswd -B /path/outside/document/root/htpasswdfile alice\n</code></pre> <p>Using the brypt algorithm with <code>htpasswd</code> also enables the use of the <code>-C</code> option. Using this option, the computing time used to calculate the password hash may be influenced. By default, the system uses a setting of 5. A value between 4 and 31 may be provided. Depending on the available resources, a value up to 18 should be acceptable to generate whilst increasing security. To add the user eve to the existing <code>htpasswdfile</code> while increasing the computing time to a value of 18, the following syntax may be used:</p> <pre><code>    htpasswd -B -C18 /path/outside/document/root/htpasswdfile eve\n</code></pre> <p>In the examples above, it is suggested that the password file is created outside of the webserver document tree. Otherwise, it could be possible for clients to download the password file.</p> <p>To use the generated password file for authentication purposes, Apache has to be aware of the <code>htpasswdfile</code> file. This can be accomplished by defining the <code>AuthUserFile</code> directive. This directive may be defined in either the Apache configuration files, or in a seperate <code>.htaccess</code> file. That <code>.htaccess</code> file should be located inside the directory of the document root it should represent. The Apache config responsible for that document root should have the <code>AllowOverride</code> directive specified. This way Apache will override directives from its configuration for directories that have <code>.htaccess</code> documents in them. The syntax for the <code>.htaccess</code> documents is the same as for Apache configuration files. A code block to use for user authentication could look as follows:</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Directory /web/document/root&gt;\n    AuthName \"Authentication Required\"\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthUserFile /path/outside/document/root/htpasswdfile\n    Require valid-user\n    Documentroot /web/document/root\n    &lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Consult the contents of your Apache modules directory for the presence of mod_auth* files. There are multiple authentication and authorization modules available. Each has its own purpose, and some depend on each other. Each module adds functionality within Apache. This functionality can be addressed by using specific module-specific directives. Refer to the Apache documentation website https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/ for detailed usage options regarding the modules available for Apache 2.4.</p> <p>Configuring authentication modules</p> <p>ConfiguringApache Authentication Modules Apache security modules are configured by configuration directives. These are read from either the centralized configuration files (mostly found under or in the <code>/etc/</code> directory) or from decentralized <code>.htaccess</code> files. The latter are mostly used to restrict access to directories and are placed in the top level directory of the tree they help to protect. For example, authentication Apache.htaccess modules will read the location of their databases using the ApacheAuthUserFile ApacheAuthDBMGroupFile <code>AuthUserFile</code> or <code>AuthDBMGroupFile</code> directives.</p> <p>Centralized configuration.</p> <p>This is an example of a configuration as it might occur in a centralized configuration file: ApacheAuthType ApacheRequire valid-user</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Directory /home/johnson/public_html&gt;\n    &lt;Files foo.bar&gt;\n    AuthName \"Foo for Thought\"\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthUserFile /home/johnson/foo.htpasswd\n    Require valid-user\n    &lt;/Files&gt;\n    &lt;/Directory&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The resource being protected is \"any file named foo.bar\" in the <code>/home/johnson/public_html</code> directory or any underlying subdirectory. Likewise, the file specifies whom are authorized to access <code>foo.bar</code>: any user that has credentials in the <code>/home/johnson/foo.htpasswd</code> file.</p> <p>Decentralized configuration.</p> <p>The alternate approach is to place a <code>.htaccess</code> file in the top level directory of any document tree that needs access protection. Note that you must set the directive <code>AllowOverride</code> ApacheAllowOverride in the central configuration to enable this.</p> <p>The first section of <code>.htaccess</code> determines which authentication type should be used. It can contain the name of the password or group file to be used, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>    AuthUserFile {path to passwd file}\n    AuthGroupFile {path to group file}\n    AuthName {title for dialog box}\n    AuthType Basic\n</code></pre> <p>The second section of <code>.htaccess</code> ensures that only user <code>{username}</code> can access (GET) the current directory:</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Limit GET&gt;\n    require user {username} \n    &lt;/Limit&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Limit</code> section can contain other directives to ApacheLimit restrict access to certain IP addresses or to a group of users.</p> <p>The following would permit any client on the local network (IP addresses 10.*.*.*) to access the <code>foo.html</code> page and require a username and password for anyone else:</p> <pre><code>    &lt;Files foo.html&gt;\n    Order Deny,Allow\n    Deny from All\n    Allow from 10.0.0.0/8\n    AuthName \"Insiders Only\"\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthUserFile /usr/local/web/apache/.htpasswd-foo\n    Require valid-user\n    Satisfy Any\n    &lt;/Files&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.1/#user-files","title":"User files","text":"<p>The <code>mod_auth</code> module uses plain text files that contain lists of valid users.

Group files contain group names followed by the names of the people in the group. By authorizing a group, all users in that group have access. Group files are known as <code>.htgroup</code> files and by convention bear that name - though you can use any name you want. Group files can be located anywhere in the directory tree but are normally placed in the toplevel directory of the tree they help to protect. To allow the use of group files you will need to include some directives in the Apache main configuration file. This will normally be inside the proper <code>Directory</code> definition. Where the <code>AuthUserFile</code> may specify either an absolute or relative path, the <code>AuthGroupFile</code> directive will always treat the provided argument as relative to the <code>ServerRoot</code>. The <code>AuthGroupFile</code> file functions as an addition to the <code>AuthUserFile</code>. The file should contain a group on each line, followed by a colon. An example:</p> <p>ApacheAuthGroupFile Apache main configuration file:</p> <pre><code>    ...\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd\n    AuthGroupFile /var/www/.htgroup\n    Require group Management\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>The associated <code>.htgroup</code> file might have the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>    Management: bob alice\n    Accounting: joe\n</code></pre> <p>Now the accounts \"bob\" and \"alice\" would have access to the resource but account \"joe\" would not due to the \"Require group Management\" statement in the main configuration file because \"joe\" is not a member of the required \"Management\" group. For this to work the users specified in the <code>.htgroup</code> file must have an entry in the <code>.htpasswd</code> file as well.</p> <p>Note A username can be in more than one group entry. This simply means that the user is a member of both groups.</p> <p>To use a DBM database (as used by <code>mod_auth_db</code>) you may use <code>dbmmanage</code>.

You have full access to the inner workings of the web server and can intervene at any stage of request-processing. This allows for customized processing of (to name just a few of the phases) <code>URI-&gt;filename</code> translation, authentication, response generation and logging. There is very little run-time overhead.</p> <p>The standard Common Gateway Interface (CGI) within Apache can be replaced entirely with Perl code that handles the response generation phase of request processing. <code>mod_perl</code> includes two general purpose modules for this purpose. The first is <code>Apache::Registry</code>, which can transparently run well-written existing perl CGI scripts. If you have badly written scripts, you should rewrite them. If you lack resources, you may choose to use the second module <code>Apache::PerlRun</code> instead because it doesn't use caching and is far more permissive then <code>Apache::Registry</code>.</p> <p>You can configure your <code>httpd</code> server and handlers in Perl using <code>PerlSetVar</code>, and <code>&lt;Perl&gt;</code> ApachePerlSetVar sections. You can also define your own configuration directives, to be read by your own modules.</p> <p>There are many ways to install <code>mod_perl</code>, e.g. as a DSO, either using APXS or not, from source or from RPM's.

PHP started as a quick Perl hack written by Rasmus Lerdorf in late 1994. Later he rewrote his code in C and hence the \\\"Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter\\\" (PHP/FI) was born. Over the next two to three years, it evolved into PHP/FI 2.0. Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans wrote a new parser in the summer of 1997, which led to the introduction of PHP 3.0. PHP 3.0 defined the syntax and semantics used in both versions 3 and 4. PHP became the de facto programming language for millions of web developers. Still another version of the (Zend) parser and much better support for object oriented programming led to the introduction of version 5.0 in july 2004. Several subversions followed and also version 6 was started to include native Unicode support. However this version was abandoned. The current version of PHP at the time of writing is PHP 8</p> <p>PHP can be called from the CGI interface, but the common approach is to configure PHP in the Apache web server as a (dynamic) DSO module. To do this, you can either use pre-built modules extracted from RPM's or roll your own from the source code. You need to configure the <code>make</code> process first. To tell <code>configure</code> to build the module as a DSO, you need to tell it to use APXS:</p> <pre><code>    ./configure -with-apxs\n</code></pre> <p>.. or, in case you want to specify the location for the <code>apxs</code> binary:</p> <pre><code>    ./configure -with-apxs={path-to-apxs}/apxs\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you can compile PHP by running the <code>make</code> command. Once all the source files are successfully compiled, install PHP by using the <code>make install</code> command.</p> <p>Before Apache can use PHP, it has to know about the PHP module and when to use it. The <code>apxs</code> program took care of telling Apache about the PHP module, so all that is left to do is tell Apache about <code>.php</code> files.

There are two methods to implement virtual hosting:</p> <p>Name-based virtual hosting</p> <p>With name-based virtual hosting, the HTTP server relies on the client (e.g. the browser) to report the hostname as part of the HTTP request headers.

You need to configure  your DNS server to map each domain name to the correct IP address first. Then, configure the Apache HTTP Server to recognize the different domain names and serve the appropriate websites.</p> <p>Name-based virtual hosting eases the demand for scarce IPv4 addresses. Therefore you could (or should) use name-based virtual hosting unless there is a specific reason to choose IP-based virtual hosting, see IP-based Virtual Hosting.</p> <p>To use name-based virtual hosting, you must designate the IP address (and possibly port) on the server that will be accepting requests for the hosts. On Apache 2.x up to 2.4, this is configured using the <code>NameVirtualHost</code> directive. This <code>NameVirtualHost</code> directive is deprectated since Apache 2.4. Each <code>VirtualHost</code> also implies a <code>NameVirtualHost</code>, so defining a <code>VirtualHost</code> is sufficient from Apache 2.4 on. Any available IP address can be used. There should be a balance between ease of configuration, use and administration on one hand, and security on the other. Using a wildcard as the listening IP address inside a <code>NameVirtualHost</code> or <code>VirtualHost</code> segment will enable the functionality of that specific configuration on all IP addresses specified by the <code>Listen</code> directive of Apache's main configuration file. If the main configuration file also uses a wildcard for the <code>Listen</code> option, this will result in the availability of the Apache HTTPD server on all configured IP addresses of the server. And therefore, the availability of the previously mentioned functionality on all of these IP addresses as well. Whether or not this is either preferable or imposes risk, depends on the circumstances. If the server is using multiple network interfaces and/or IP addresses, special care should be taken when configuring services. Every daemon exposing services to the network could contain code based or configuration based errors. These errors could be abused by someone with malicious intentions. By minimizing the so called network footprint of the server, the available attack surface is also minimized. Whether or not the additional configuration overhead of preventing wildcards is worth the effort, will always remain a trade off.</p> <ul> <li><code>Listen</code> can be used to specify the IP addresses and ports to which     an Apache listener should be opened in order to serve the configured     content.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> directive is the next step to create for each different webdomain you would like to serve. The argument to the  <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> directive should be the same as the argument to  the (pre-Apache 2.4) <code>NameVirtualHost</code> directive (i.e., an IP address or <code>*</code> for all addresses). Inside each <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> block you will need, at minimum, a <code>ServerName</code> directive to designate which host is served and a <code>DocumentRoot</code> directive to point out where in the filesystem the content for that webdomain can be found.</p> <p>Suppose that both <code>www.domain.tld</code> and <code>www.otherdomain.tld</code> point to the IP address <code>111.22.33.44</code>. You could then add the following to <code>httpd.conf</code> or equivalent (included) configuration file:</p> <pre><code>    NameVirtualHost 111.22.33.44\n\n    &lt;VirtualHost 111.22.33.44&gt;\n        ServerName www.domain.tld\n        DocumentRoot /www/domain\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n\n    &lt;VirtualHost 111.22.33.44&gt;\n        ServerName www.otherdomain.tld\n        DocumentRoot /www/otherdomain\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The IP address <code>111.22.44.33</code> could be replaced by <code>*</code> to match all IP addresses for this server. The implications of using wildcards in this way have been addressed above.</p> <p>Many websites should be accessible by more than one name. For instance, the organization behind <code>domain.tld</code> wants to facilitate <code>blog.domain.tld</code>. There are multiple ways to implement this functionality, but one of them uses the <code>ServerAlias</code> directive. The <code>ServerAlias</code> directive is declared inside the \\&lt;VirtualHost&gt; section.</p> <p>If, for example, you add the following to the first \\&lt;VirtualHost&gt; block above</p> <pre><code>    ServerAlias domain.tld *.domain.tld\n</code></pre> <p>then requests for all hosts in the <code>domain.tld</code> domain will be served by the <code>www.domain.tld</code> virtual host. The wildcard characters <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> can be used to match names.</p> <p>Of course, you can't just make up names and place them in <code>ServerName</code> or <code>ServerAlias</code>. The DNS system must be properly configured to map those names to the IP address(es) declared in the <code>NameVirtualHost</code> directive.</p> <p>Finally, you can fine-tune the configuration of the virtual hosts by placing other directives inside the <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> containers. Most directives can be placed in these containers and will then change the configuration only of the relevant virtual host. Configuration directives set in the main server context (outside any <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> container) will be used only if they are not overridden by the virtual host settings.</p> <p>Now when a request arrives, the server will first check if it is requesting an IP address that matches the <code>NameVirtualHost</code>. If it is, then it will look at each <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> section with a matching IP address and try to find one where the <code>ServerName</code> or <code>ServerAlias</code> matches the requested hostname. If it finds one, it then uses the corresponding configuration for that server.

If a directive is not explicitly defined, Apache will use a default setting. This default may vary per Linux distribution, so consult your distribution's Apache documentation. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is a good place to start. Configuration files can be checked for syntax errors using either of the following commands:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo apachectl configtest\n    $ sudo service httpd configtest\n</code></pre> <p>Because Apache usually serves a daemon that listens to ports below 1024, sudo or a root shell should be used to invoke all Apache related commands. Refer to your system documentation to check for the availability of the <code>apachectl</code> or <code>apache2ctl</code> command. If both exist, they might be symlinked. The naming difference for this command has a historical reason. <code>apachectl</code> was used for Apache 1.x and when Apache2 was released the command was hence renamed match the new name. Now that Apache2.x has become the standard, either <code>apache2ctl</code> has been renamed to <code>apachectl</code> or both commands are available for compatibility reasons. When available, the <code>service</code> facility may point to httpd on Red Hat based systems, or to apache2 on Debian-based systems: The <code>apachectl</code> command has many useful options. It is in fact a shell script that functions as a wrapper for the httpd binary. Consult the man page for all available arguments and options. Just two more examples to get you started: To show all configured virtual hosts, use:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo apachectl -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS\n</code></pre> <p>To show all currently running websites, use:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo apachectl -S\n</code></pre> <p>Be careful interpreting the output from the command above. That output shows the configuration of the currently running websites. There is no guarantee that the website configuration on disk has changed since these websites were brought online. In other words: The output from the running processes does not necessarily have to match the contents of the configuration files (anymore).</p> <p>In regards to the Apache configuration files, it is important to know about the different ways Apache may be installed and configured. Depending on the Linux distribution and Apache2.x version in use, configuration files may be located and even named differently across otherwise similar systems. As we will see further down this chapter, Apache often uses one main configuration file. Within this file, other configuration files may be included using the <code>INCLUDE /path/to/other/config</code> directive. The configuration file syntax may be checked for errors by invoking the <code>apachectl</code> script as shown previously. Each configuration file that is included from the main configuration file in use will be checked for consistency and syntax. Consistency here means that if a dependant configuration file, certificate file or key file can not be accessed properly by the user the httpd binary runs as, a warning will be shown. If <code>apachectl</code> does not appear in your <code>$PATH</code>, use the <code>sudo find</code> command with <code>apachectl</code> or <code>apache2ctl</code> as an argument. Depending on the size of your storage volumes, it may be wiser to narrow this search down to specific directories. You have been warned. If the <code>service</code> command is not available on your system, the Apache daemon may be started, checked and stopped by a SysV script instead. Look within the <code>/etc/init.d/</code> directory for a script called <code>httpd</code>, <code>apache2</code> or equivalent. This script may be then called upon as follows, to reveal the available arguments:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#encrypted-webservers-ssl","title":"Encrypted webservers: SSL","text":"<p>Apache can support SSL/TLS for (reasonably) secure SSL/TLS online communication. While TLS in version 1.2 is actually the currently favourable option, TLS encrypted HTTPS sessions are still referred to as 'SSL' encrypted sessions. TLS could in fact be seen as the successor to SSL (v3.0). So, just as with Apache versus Apache2, whenever Apache/SSL is mentioned in this chapter, TLS is implied as well. Unless otherwise specified. We will cover the strengths and weaknesses of both protocols further down this chapter.</p> <p>The Secure Sockets Layer protocol (SSL) is a protocol which may be placed between a reliable connection-oriented network layer protocol (e.g., TCP/IP) and the application layer protocol (e.g., HTTP). SSL provides secure communication between client and server by allowing mutual authentication and the use of digital signatures for integrity and encryption for privacy. Currently there are two versions of SSL still in use: version 2 and version 3. Additionally, the successor to SSL, TLS (version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, which are based on SSL), TLS were designed by the IETF organisation.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#public-key-cryptography","title":"Public key cryptography","text":"<p>SSL/TLS uses Public Key Cryptography (PKC), also known as asymmetric PKC CryptographyPublic Key cryptography. Public key cryptography is used in situations where the sender and receiver do not share a common secret, e.g., between browsers and web servers, but wish to establish a trusted channel for their communication.</p> <p>PKC defines an algorithm which uses two keys, each of which may be used to encrypt a message. If one key is used to encrypt a message, then the other must be used to decrypt it. This makes it possible to receive secure messages by simply publishing one key (the public key) and keeping the other key secret (the private key). Anyone may encrypt a message using the public key, but only the owner of the private key will be able to read it. For example, Alice may send private messages to the owner of a key-pair (e.g., your web server), by encrypting the messages using the public key your server publishes. Only the server will be able to decrypt it using the corresponding private key.</p> <p></p> <p>A secure web server (e.g., Apache/SSL) uses HTTP over SSL/TLS, https Apache443 using port 443 by default. The SSL/TLS port can be configured by defining the <code>Listen</code> directive inside the main configuration file. There should already be a listener configured for port 80 (HTTP). On Debian-based systems, there is a dedicated file for defining the active listeners. This file is called <code>ports.conf</code> and is included from the main configuration file. Apart from this file, individual websites should specify the listening host at the end of the <code>ServerName</code> or <code>NameVirtualHost</code> declaration. Starting from Apache v2.4, <code>NameVirtualHost</code> has been deprecated in favour of <code>VirtualHost</code>. A declaration like that could look as follows: <code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;</code>. Within the browser, the use of HTTPS is signified by the use of the https:// scheme in the URL. The public key is exchanged during the set-up of the communication between server and client (browser). That public key should be signed (it contains a digital signature e.g., a message digest) by a so-called valid CA (Certificate Authority). Each browser contains a number of so-called Certificate Authority root-certificates: these can be used to determine the validity of the CA's that signed the key. Not every certificate out there is signed by one of these valid CA's. Especially for testing purposes, it is common to sign certificates without the intervention of a valid CA. This is done in order to save both (validation) time and (registration fee) money. As of 2015, it has become easier to maintain valid CA signed certificate. An organisation called Let's Encrypt is willing to sign certificates for free, as long as you play by the rules.

We urge you to take the time to read through the resources collected at the following URL: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/</p> <p>The subject of encryption is so vast and complicated that entire books have been written around about it. The added confidentiality and integrity only provide their value when encryption is implemented correctly. So called 'best practices' in regards to encryption may change overnight. In addition to the collection of resources listed at the URL above, we want to add the following URL: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/ssl/ssl_howto.html</p> <p>As you can see, this URL does not point to the current version of the documentation. Instead, it points to the trunk version. At the time of this writing, this corresponds to the Apache 2.5 documentation. The trunk documentation will always point towards the most recent Apache version in development. And while the trunk Apache code may not be recommended to use, the documentation may be more recently updated than elsewhere. In regards to the subject of SSL/TLS, this results in more up-to-date best practices than the 2.4 documentation provides.</p> <p>The documentation provided by The Apache Software Foundation is vendor-neutral. So when the Apache documentation states that the following directives should be present in the Apache main configuration file:</p> <pre><code>    LoadModule mod_ssl modules/mod_ssl.so\n    Listen 443\n    &lt;Vhost&gt;\n    &lt;/Vhost&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>It can very well be that these directives are configured amongst several configuration files. This depends on your Linux distribution. In addition to the documentation provided by The Apache Software Foundation, we will try to point out the configuration differences between Red Hat and Debian based distributions.</p> <p>To use <code>mod_ssl</code> you will need to install the Apache and mod_ssl package. Apachemod_ssl On Red Hat based systems, this is done using the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo yum install httpd mod_ssl\n</code></pre> <p>On Debian-based systems, this is done using the following command:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo apt-get install apache2 openssl\n</code></pre> <p>After installation, make sure the OpenSSL module is enabled within Apache. The module should be available to the Apache daemon, and included to be loaded during daemon start-up. Again, there are several ways this can be achieved. A common way is similar to the <code>websites-available</code> and <code>websites-enabled</code> strategy. However, now we are dealing with <code>modules-available</code> and <code>modules-                 enabled</code> directories instead. As a plus, Debian-based systems come with a utility called <code>a2enmod</code>. By invoking this command as follows:</p> <pre><code>    $ sudo a2enmod enable ssl\n</code></pre> <p><code>a2enmod</code> will create symlinks within the <code>mods-enabled                  directory, pointing to respectively                  mods-available/ssl.conf</code> and <code>mods-available/ssl.load</code>. When Apache is reloaded, these symlinks will ensure the SSL module will be loaded as well.</p> <p>Red Hat based systems use the <code>LoadModule</code> directive instead. This directive should be declared so it will be read during the start of the Apache daemon. On a Red Hat based system, this could be achieved by a <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code> that holds the following INCLUDE directive:</p> <pre><code>    Include conf.d/*conf\n</code></pre> <p>The default file <code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code> could then contain the following <code>LoadModule</code> and <code>Listen</code> statements:</p> <pre><code>    LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\n    Listen 443\n</code></pre> <p>After reloading Apache, the SSL module should be loaded together with the Apache daemon. It is always a good practice to check for configuration errors before restarting the Apache daemon. This can be done using the <code>apachectl configtest</code> command and has been covered earlier. The output should be clear to interpret whether Apache will encounter errors or not, and why (it will).</p> <p>Then, generate a key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Either sign the csr file yourself, thus creating a 'self-signed' certificate, or have it signed by a valid Certificate Authority (CA). Depending on who you are, a self-signed certificate might cause browser-warnings when presented via HTTPS. Having the csr signed by a valid CA might prevent this from happening.</p> <p>Some additional directives should be used to configure the secure server - for example the location of the key-files. It's beyond the scope of this book to document all of these directives. However, you should be familiar with most of the mod_ssl directives. You can find best practices by searching the web and should also refer to your distribution's specific mod_ssl documentation. The generic mod_ssl documentation can be found on the <code>mod_ssl</code> <code>mod_ssl</code> web-site.</p> <p><code>mod_ssl</code> can also be used to authenticate clients using client certificates. These client certificates can be signed by your own CA and <code>mod_ssl</code> will validate the certificates against this CA. To enable this functionality set the <code>SSLVerifyClient</code> to <code>require</code>. Use the value <code>none</code> to turn it off.</p> <p>Certificates that are installed as part of your Linux distribution are usually installed in <code>/etc/ssl/certs</code> on Debian-based systems, and in <code>/etc/pki/tls/certs</code> on Red Hat based systems. The Red Hat based systems may have a symlink in place that points <code>/etc/ssl/certs</code> to <code>/etc/pki/tls/certs</code> for convenience and compatibility.</p> <p>Keys or key-files that are installed as part of your Linux distribution are in turn usually installed in <code>/etc/ssl/private</code> on Debian-based systems and in <code>/etc/pki/tls/private</code> on Red Hat based systems. Other directories within <code>/etc/ssl</code> and <code>/etc/pki</code> may also contain specific key files.</p> <p>It is often considered a best practice to create subdirectories when working with specific keys and/or certificates. Especially because specific cryptographic keys and certificates belong to each other. By devoting a dedicated subdirectory to each keypair, structure will be maintained within both the filesystem and configuration files pointing to these files. These subdirecties may be created as part of the <code>/etc/ssl</code> or <code>/etc/pki</code> hierarchy. But creating subdirectories below <code>/etc/apache2</code> or <code>/etc/httpd</code> can be done as well.</p> <p>Directory /etc/ssl/ {#apachessl}</p> <pre><code>                /etc/ssl$ ls -l\n                total 32\n                drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     16384 2011-03-06 15:31 certs\n                -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      9374 2010-09-24 22:05 openssl.cnf\n                drwx--x--- 2 root ssl-cert  4096 2011-03-06 13:19 private\n</code></pre> <p>openssl The <code>openssl</code> program is a command line interface to the OpenSSL crypto library. You can use it to generate certificates, encrypt and decrypt files, create hashes and much more. It is generally seen as \"the Swiss Army knife\" of cryptography. One of the more common usages is to generate (self-signed) certificates for use on a secured webserver (to support the <code>https</code> protocol). <code>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</code> is the standard location for its configuration file, where you can set defaults for the name of your organization, the address etc.</p> <p>Note If you generate a certificate for a webserver you start by creating a Certificate Signing Request (.csr). The <code>openssl</code> tool will prompt you for information it needs to create the request, using defaults it fetches from the configuration file. When you generate such a signing request, make sure you enter the FQDN (\\\"Fully Qualified Domain Name\\\") of the server when <code>openssl</code> Fully Qualified Domain Name prompts you for the \"Common Name\" or CN (which is part of the \"Distinguished Name\"). For example when you generate a CSR for the web-site Common Name <code>https://www.foo.example/</code>, enter <code>www.foo.example</code> as the CN. Be aware that a certificate providing <code>foo.example</code> would not be valid for the website accessed via <code>https://www.foo.example</code>. Neither would this certificate be valid for the website behind the URL <code>https://webmail.foo.example</code>. Seperate certificates for each domain should be put in place. To combat this necessity, many organizations choose to use wilcard- certificates. Especially for internal hosted websites. When issuing a CSR for a certificate that could be used to serve any of the <code>.foo.example</code> websites, the request should be done for the CN value <code>*.foo.example</code>. Browsers will understand this wildcard certificate when presented, and decide accordingly. <code>www.foo.example</code> and <code>webmail.foo.example</code> could be configured to use this certificate. <code>https://foo.example</code> on the other hand, would issue a browser warning with this certificate.</p> <p>How to create a SSL server Certificate {#apachesslcert}</p> <p>While installing OpenSSL, the program <code>openssl</code> is installed CreatingSSL Server Certificate on your system. This command can be used to create the necessary files that implement a (self-signed) server certificate.</p> <p>More specifically:</p> <ul> <li> <p>RSA You start by generating the RSA key file. It contains a pair     of related keys, used to encrypt and decrypt messages to and from     you. One half of the keypair will be used to encrypt messages that     will be sent to you using the public key. The other half is used     to decrypt these received messages using the private key. The     public key will be made part of your digital certificate. This     allows client systems to sent encrypted messages to your webserver     that only this webserver can decrypt, as it holds the related     private key;</p> </li> <li> <p>Next you will create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).     Certificate Signing Request This is a file which contains the public     key and identifying information like the name of your company,     location etc;</p> </li> <li> <p>The CSR is sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) which should     verify the correctness of the information you provided and generate     the certificate. This certificate contains a digital signature     that allows verification that the CA has approved of the contents of     the certificate. The certificate will contain the data you provided     (including your public key) and it is signed by the CA using its     private key. A certificate contains your RSA public key, your     name, the name of the CA and is digitally signed by your CA.     Browsers that know the CA can verify the Certificate Authority     signature on that certificate, thereby obtaining your RSA public     key. That enables them to send messages which only you can decrypt.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note You can create a signing request and then sign it yourself. In fact, that is what Certificate Authorities do when they create their <code>root certificate</code>. A <code>root                  certificate</code> is simply a certificate that says that they say they are whom they say they are. So, anybody can create a root certificate and put any credentials on it just as they please. The root certificate itself is no proof of anything. You will need to ensure that it really was issued by a party you trust yourself. Either you visit them and get a copy directly from them, or fetch it using another method you trust or you rely on others you trust to have done this for you. One of the ways you implicitly \"trust\" a large number of CAs is by relying on their root certificates that are made part of your browser.</p> <p>Triple-DES PEM As an example: to create an RSA private key that has a keysize of 2048 bits, and which will be triple-des (3DES) encrypted, stored in a file named <code>server.key</code> in the default format (which is known as PEM), type:</p> <pre><code>    $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048\n</code></pre> <p>RSA keysizes below 1024 bits are considered out-of-date. 1024 bits seems to be a best practice today, with 2048, 3072, 4096 and onwards being valid options if all involved components are able to handle these keysizes without overexceeding thresholds.</p> <p>openssl <code>openssl</code> will ask for a pass-phrase, which will be used as the key to encrypt the private key. Please store this file in a secure backup location and remember the pass-phrase. If you loose the pass-phrase you will not be able to recover the key.</p> <p>For testing purposes, it might be preferable to strip the password from the key file. This can accomplished by reading the key and exporting it as follows:</p> <pre><code>    $ openssl rsa -in server.key -out stripped.key\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>server.key</code> file still holds the encrypted private key information in ciphertext. The <code>stripped.key</code> file is a plain text file with the unencrypted private key information as its contents. Handle with care.</p> <p>To create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with the server RSA private key (output will be PEM formatted), execute the following:</p> <pre><code>    $ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr\n</code></pre> <p>The signing request can now either be sent to a real CA, which will sign the request and create a digital certificate, or you can create your own CA and do it yourself. Note that if you do it yourself, you will also need to install the root certificate of your CA into your clients (e.g. browser) to signal them that a certificate signed by your own CA can be trusted. If you omit this step, you will be getting a lot of disturbing warnings about missing trust and insecurity.</p> <p>CA.pl You can provide the <code>openssl</code> parameters yourself, but that can be a daunting task for less experienced users. Hence, for conveniences sake the OpenSSL software suite provides a perl script (<code>CA.pl</code>) to handle most CA related tasks a lot easier. It has a simplified syntax and supplies the more complex command line arguments to the underlying <code>openssl</code> command.</p> <p><code>CA.pl</code> will default use values it reads from the standard OpenSSL configuration file <code>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</code>. To create your own CA, find the <code>CA</code> shellscript or <code>CA.pl</code> perlscript that should be part of the OpenSSL package. On Red Hat based systems, this script is located in the <code>/etc/pki/tls/misc</code> directory. Depending on your distribution, the script might not interpret filenames for arguments. The script then instead looks for predifined values for the key file and csr file. Page the script source using a command like <code>less</code> or <code>more</code> and look for clues. The STDERR output might also show some valueable pointers. In the following example, <code>newkey.pem</code> and <code>newreq.pem</code> are used as file names by the <code>CA.pl</code> script:</p> <pre><code>    # /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl -newca\n    CA certificate filename (or enter to create)\n\n    Making CA certificate ...\n    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key\n    ........................+++\n    ..................................+++\n    writing new private key to './demoCA/private/cakey.pem'\n    Enter PEM pass phrase: ********\n    Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: ********\n    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated\n    into your certificate request.\n    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\n    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\n    For some fields there will be a default value,\n    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.\n    -----\n    Country Name (2 letter code) [NL]:\n    State or Province Name (full name) [None]:\n    Locality Name (eg, city) []:\n    Organization Name (eg, company) [Sue B.V.]:\n    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:ssltest.sue.nl\n    Email Address []:\n\n    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes\n    to be sent with your certificate request\n    A challenge password []:\n    An optional company name []:\n    Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf\n    Enter pass phrase for ./demoCA/private/cakey.pem:\n    Check that the request matches the signature\n    Signature ok\n    Certificate Details:\n    Serial Number:\n    ca:d8:22:43:94:6d:ca:6c\n    Validity\n    Not Before: Jul  9 13:49:38 2019 GMT\n    Not After : Jul  8 13:49:38 2020  GMT\n    Subject:\n    countryName               = NL\n    stateOrProvinceName       = None\n    organizationName          = Sue B.V.\n    commonName                = ssltest.sue.nl\n    X509v3 extensions:\n    X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: \n    83:F3:99:4B:98:E0:F1:37:78:67:DC:04:AC:04:65:03:48:BB:31:FB\n    X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: \n    keyid:83:F3:99:4B:98:E0:F1:37:78:67:DC:04:AC:04:65:03:48:BB:31:FB\n\n    X509v3 Basic Constraints: \n    CA:TRUE\n    Certificate is to be certified until Jul  8 13:49:38 2016 GMT (1095 days)\n\n    Write out database with 1 new entries\n    Data Base Updated\n</code></pre> <p>Next create a signing request:</p> <pre><code>    # /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl -newreq\n    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key\n    ...........................+++\n    ...........................+++\n    writing new private key to 'newkey.pem'\n    Enter PEM pass phrase:\n    Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:\n    -----\n    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated\n    into your certificate request.\n    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\n    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\n    For some fields there will be a default value,\n    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.\n    -----\n    Country Name (2 letter code) [NL]:\n    State or Province Name (full name) []:None\n    Locality Name (eg, city) []:\n    Organization Name (eg, company) []:Sue B.V.\n    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:ssltest.sue.nl\n    Email Address []:\n\n    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes\n    to be sent with your certificate request\n    A challenge password []:\n    An optional company name []:\n    Request is in newreq.pem, private key is in newkey.pem\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we sign the request:</p> <pre><code>    # /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl -signreq\n    Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf\n    Enter pass phrase for ./demoCA/private/cakey.pem:\n    Check that the request matches the signature\n    Signature ok\n    Certificate Details:\n    Serial Number:\n    ca:d8:22:43:94:6d:ca:6d\n    Validity\n    Not Before: Jul  9 13:53:53 2013 GMT\n    Not After : Jul  9 13:53:53 2014 GMT\n    Subject:\n    countryName               = NL\n    stateOrProvinceName       = None\n    organizationName          = Sue B.V.\n    commonName                = ssltest.sue.nl\n    X509v3 extensions:\n    X509v3 Basic Constraints: \n    CA:FALSE\n    Netscape Comment: \n    OpenSSL Generated Certificate\n    X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: \n    21:A4:61:83:B4:E7:C3:E9:2B:2C:0A:DD:36:FA:82:D0:77:3A:E2:01\n    X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: \n    keyid:83:F3:99:4B:98:E0:F1:37:78:67:DC:04:AC:04:65:03:48:BB:31:FB\n\n    Certificate is to be certified until Jul  9 13:53:53 2014 GMT (365 days)\n    Sign the certificate?

You might want to rename the file to something more distinguishable, e.g <code>Certificate:ssltest.sue.nl</code>. While at it, rename the server key file too, for example <code>PrivateKey:ssltest.sue.nl</code>. Especially if you maintain a lot of keys and certificates on a lot of servers, it really helps to be able to learn from the name of a file what is in it.</p> <p>The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) could have been sent to an external Certificate Authority (CA) instead. You usually have to post the CSR into a web form, pay for the signing and await a signed Certificate. There are non-profit CA's that will perform similar tasks free of charge, for example <code>CAcert</code>. However, their root certificate is not yet included into most browsers so you will need to do that yourself if you are going to use their services.</p> <p>The <code>server.csr</code> file is no longer needed. Now you have two files: ApacheSSLCertificateFile ApacheSSLCertificateKeyFile <code>server.key</code> and <code>newcert.pem</code>. In your Apache's <code>httpd.conf</code> file you should refer to them using lines like these:</p> <pre><code>    SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/Certificate:ssltest.sue.nl\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/PrivateKey:ssltest.sue.nl\n</code></pre> <p>It is considered a best practice to follow the 'least privilege' principle when managing key and certificate files. These files should preferebly be stored in a way that only the user account that runs the web server can access them.</p> <p>Apache SSL Directives {#ssldir}</p> <p>The following Apache SSL configuration directives should be familiar to you:</p> <p><code>SSLEngine</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive toggles the usage of the SSL/TLS Protocol Engine.     This should be used inside a \\&lt;VirtualHost&gt; section to enable     SSL/TLS for a that virtual host. By default the SSL/TLS Protocol     Engine is disabled for both the main server and all configured     virtual hosts.</li> </ul> <p><code>SSLCertificateKeyFile</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive points to the PEM-encoded private key file for the     server. If the contained private key is encrypted, the pass phrase     dialog is forced at startup time. This directive can be used up to     three times (referencing different filenames) when an RSA, a DSA,     and an ECC based private key is used in parallel. For each     SSLCertificateKeyFile directive, there must be a matching     SSLCertificateFile directive.</li> </ul> <p><code>SSLCertificateFile</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive points to a file with certificate data in PEM format.     At a minimum, the file must include an end-entity (leaf)     certificate. This directive can be used up to three times     (referencing different filenames) when an RSA, a DSA, and an ECC     based server certificate is used in parallel.</li> </ul> <p>Creating and installing a self-signed certificate for Apache {#ssssl}</p> <p>Sometimes, it might be acceptable to use a self-signed SSL certificate with Apache. The following steps explain how to accomplish this on a Debian based system. First, create a directory to hold the SSL keys. On the system we use as an example, all system-wide SSL certificates are stored in the directory <code>/etc/ssl/certs</code>. For our purpose, we create a new directory called <code>/etc/ssl/webserver</code> and use it to store our new keypair:</p> <pre><code>    # mkdir /etc/ssl/webserver\n    # openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \\\n    &gt; -out /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.pem -keyout /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.key\n    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key\n    ...............................+++\n    .......+++\n    writing new private key to '/etc/ssl/webserver/apache.key'\n    # ls /etc/ssl/webserver/\n    apache.key  apache.pem\n</code></pre> <p>Note During creation, openssl wil use the contents of <code>/etc/ssl/openssl/cnf</code> to fill in some variables. Other values will be asked by an interactive script. Be sure to use the proper FQDN here to distinguish this certificate from certificates with another purpose later on.</p> <p>In order to be able to use SSL with Apache, a module called <code>mod_ssl</code> has to be loaded. On this system, we can check the enabled modules by listing the contents of the <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled</code> directory. All currently available modules can be checked by listing the contents of the <code>/etc/apache2/mods-available</code> directory:</p> <pre><code>    # ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/\n    alias.conf            autoindex.conf  mime.conf         reqtimeout.load\n    alias.load            autoindex.load  mime.load         setenvif.conf\n    auth_basic.load       cgi.load        negotiation.conf  setenvif.load\n    authn_file.load       deflate.conf    negotiation.load  status.conf\n    authz_default.load    deflate.load    perl.load         status.load\n    authz_groupfile.load  dir.conf        php5.conf\n    authz_host.load       dir.load        php5.load\n    authz_user.load       env.load        reqtimeout.conf\n\n    # ls /etc/apache2/mods-available/\n    actions.conf          cgid.conf          include.load         proxy_ftp.conf\n    actions.load          cgid.load          info.conf            proxy_ftp.load\n    alias.conf            cgi.load           info.load            proxy_http.load\n    alias.load            charset_lite.load  ldap.conf            proxy.load\n    asis.load             dav_fs.conf        ldap.load            proxy_scgi.load\n    auth_basic.load       dav_fs.load        log_forensic.load    reqtimeout.conf\n    auth_digest.load      dav.load           mem_cache.conf       reqtimeout.load\n    authn_alias.load      dav_lock.load      mem_cache.load       rewrite.load\n    authn_anon.load       dbd.load           mime.conf            setenvif.conf\n    authn_dbd.load        deflate.conf       mime.load            setenvif.load\n    authn_dbm.load        deflate.load       mime_magic.conf      speling.load\n    authn_default.load    dir.conf           mime_magic.load      ssl.conf\n    authn_file.load       dir.load           mod-dnssd.conf       ssl.load\n    authnz_ldap.load      disk_cache.conf    mod-dnssd.load       status.conf\n    authz_dbm.load        disk_cache.load    negotiation.conf     status.load\n    authz_default.load    dump_io.load       negotiation.load     substitute.load\n    authz_groupfile.load  env.load           perl.load            suexec.load\n    authz_host.load       expires.load       php5.conf            unique_id.load\n    authz_owner.load      ext_filter.load    php5.load            userdir.conf\n    authz_user.load       file_cache.load    proxy_ajp.load       userdir.load\n    autoindex.conf        filter.load        proxy_balancer.conf  usertrack.load\n    autoindex.load        headers.load       proxy_balancer.load  vhost_alias.load\n    cache.load            ident.load         proxy.conf\n    cern_meta.load        imagemap.load      proxy_connect.load\n</code></pre> <p><code>ssl</code> appears to be available but has not been enabled yet because both ssl files, <code>ssl.load</code> and <code>ssl.conf</code>, are still present in the <code>/etc/apache2/mods-available/</code> directory and not in the <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/</code> directory. We could create a symlink to activate support for ssl ourselves, but Debian provides a utility written in perl called <code>a2enmod</code> that takes care of this. Consult the <code>A2ENMOD(8)</code> manpage for more information. It's counterpart, conveniently called <code>a2dismod</code>, does the opposite and disables Apache modules by removing the symlinks from <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/</code>.</p> <p>Let's enable SSL:</p> <pre><code>    # a2enmod ssl\n    Enabling module ssl.\n    See /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz on how to configure SSL \\\n        and create self-signed certificates.\n    To activate the new configuration, you need to run:\n    service apache2 restart\n    # service apache2 restart\n    [ ok ] Restarting web server: apache2 ... waiting .\n    # apachectl status |grep -i ssl\n    Server Version: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian) PHP/5.4.4-15.1 mod_ssl/2.2.22 OpenSSL/\n</code></pre> <p>SSL has now been enabled on the Apache HTTP server. In order for a site to actually use SSL, it's configuration has to be properly configured. HTTPS uses tcp port 443 by default, so we want to specify this in the apache config of Debian. Add the following line to your <code>/etc/apache2/ports.conf</code> file:</p> <pre><code>    Listen 443\n</code></pre> <p>Now, all sites that want to make use of SSL need to have their configuration files reconfigured. The following lines need to be added to each \"enabled\" site that should serve it's content by HTTPS:</p> <pre><code>    SSLEngine On\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.key\n</code></pre> <p>An example site configuration file for both a HTTP and HTTPS enabled site could be like the following:</p> <pre><code>    NameVirtualHost *:80\n    NameVirtualHost *:443\n\n    &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n    Servername  webserver.intranet\n    DocumentRoot    /srv/http\n    ErrorLog    /var/log/apache2/error.log\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n\n    &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;\n    SSLEngine   On\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/webserver/apache.key\n    Servername  webserver.intranet\n    DocumentRoot    /srv/http\n    ErrorLog    /var/log/apache2/error.log\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now, use <code>apachectl configtest</code> to test your site configuration and if no errors occur restart the Apache HTTP server. The SSL enabled sites should now be accessible by using the <code>https</code> URL instead of <code>http</code>.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#other-apache-directives","title":"Other Apache Directives","text":"<p>Apart from the directives used above, the following Apache configuration directives should be familiar to you:</p> <p><code>SSLCACertificateFile</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive sets the all-in-one file where you can assemble the     certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) whose clients you     deal with. These are used for Client Authentication. Such a file is     simply the concatenation of the various PEM-encoded certificate     files, in order of preference.</li> </ul> <p><code>SSLCACertificatePath</code></p> <ul> <li>Sets the directory where you keep the certificates of Certification     Authorities (CAs) whose clients you deal with. These are used to     verify the client certificate on Client Authentication.</li> </ul> <p><code>SSLCipherSuite</code></p> <ul> <li>This complex directive uses a colon-separated cipher-spec string     consisting of OpenSSL cipher specifications to configure the Cipher     Suite the client is permitted to negotiate in the SSL handshake     phase. Notice that this directive can be used both in per-server and     per-directory context. In per-server context it applies to the     standard SSL handshake when a connection is established. In     per-directory context it forces a SSL renegotiation with the     reconfigured Cipher Suite after the HTTP request was read but before     the HTTP response is sent.</li> </ul> <p><code>SSLProtocol</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive can be used to control the SSL protocol flavors     mod_ssl should use when establishing its server environment.     Clients then can only connect with one of the provided protocols.</li> </ul> <p><code>ServerSignature</code></p> <ul> <li>The <code>ServerSignature</code> directive allows the configuration of a     trailing footer line under server-generated documents (error     messages, mod_proxy ftp directory listings, mod_info output,     ...). The reason why you would want to enable such a footer line is     that in a chain of proxies, the user often has no possibility to     tell which of the chained servers actually produced a returned error     message.</li> </ul> <p><code>ServerTokens</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive controls whether the Server response header field     which is sent back to clients includes minimal information,     everything worth mentioning or somewhere in between. By default, the     <code>ServerTokens</code> directive is set to <code>Full</code>. By declaring this     (global) directive and setting it to <code>Prod</code>, the supplied     information will be reduced to the bare minimum. During the first     chapter of this subject the necessity for compiling Apache from     source is mentioned. Modifying the Apache Server response header     field values could be a scenario that requires modification of     source code. This could very well be part of a server hardening     process. As a result, the Apache server could provide different     values as response header fields.</li> </ul> <p><code>TraceEnable</code></p> <ul> <li>This directive overrides the behavior of <code>TRACE</code> for both the core     server and mod_proxy. The default <code>TraceEnable on</code> permits <code>TRACE</code>     requests per RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany     the request. <code>TraceEnable off</code> causes the core server and mod_proxy     to return a <code>405</code> (method not allowed) error to the client. There is     also the non-compliant setting <code>extended</code> which will allow message     bodies to accompany the trace requests. This setting should only be     used for debugging purposes. Despite what a security scan may say,     the <code>TRACE</code> method is part of the HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 specification     and should therefore not be disabled without a specific reason.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#sslvhost","title":"SSL with Apache Virtual Hosts","text":"<p>As we saw before, the FQDN plays an important part in SSL. It has to match the CN value of the certificate. This certificate is presented to the browser when initiating the connection to the HTTPS server. Only when the certificate is valid, issued by a known, trusted and registered party, and matches the hostname will the browser iniate the connection without warnings. Otherwise, the browser should present a warning about an invalid or expired certificate, an unknown issuer, or an invalid hostname. With IP-based virtual hosts we have a different IP/port combination for every virtual host, which means we can configure an SSL certificate for every virtual host. The HTTPS connection will be initiated on a dedicated IP address after all.</p> <p>When working with name based virtual hosts however, we have no unique identifier for the resource being requested except for the hostname. So the Apache HTTP server receives all requests for the virtual hosts it serves on the same IP/port combination. It isn't until after the SSL connection has been established that the HTTP server knows which virtual host is actually being requested based on the URL. The URL discloses the hostname for the virtual host. But, by then it might be too late; the client could have been offered a certificate with a different CN value due to the nature of the HTTP within SSL/TLS transaction.</p> <p>Currently, an extension called SNI (Server Name Indication) can be used to circumvent this name based issue. Using this extension, the browser includes the requested hostname in the first message of its SSL handshake as an UTF-8 encoded byte-string value representing the <code>server_name</code> attribute of the client hello message. This value should only consist of host and/or domain names. No IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses should be used. Both the browser and Apache need to support SNI in order for the SNI mechanism to work. If SNI is used on the server and the browser doesn't support SNI the browser could show a \"untrusted certificate\" warning. This depends on the certificate that is presented for the \"default\" website of the HTTP server. As of this writing, most browsers do support SNI. Exceptions are the Android 2.x default browser, MS Internet Explorer on MS Windows XP before SP3 and versions of Oracle Java before 1.7 on any operating system.</p> <p>To use SNI on the Apache server and prevent \"untrusted certificate\" warnings due to non-SNI capable browsers, it is possible to use a multidomain certificate. This certificate should contain all the necessary domain names and should be used in the Apache configuration in a separate virtual host. In this virtual host no servername should be configured and because of this it will match all requests without a hostname and therefore serving all browsers without SNI support. Apache will show the content of the right requested (SNI) site due to the requested website being extracted from the URL. This extraction takes place after the encrypted session has been created, using the multidomain certificate. This solution will probably never receive an award for it's looks, but the science behind it at least works.</p> <p>Without SNI, a web server can serve multiple name based virtual hosts over HTTPS without browser warnings. With the requirement (or restriction) that the SSL certificate being used will be the same for all virtual hosts. The virtual hosts also have to be part of the same domain, e.g.: <code>virtual01.example.com</code> and <code>virtual02.example.com</code>. The SSL certificate has to be configured in such a way that the CN (Common Name) points to a wildcard for the domain being used, e.g.: <code>*.example.com</code>.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#ssl-security-issues","title":"SSL Security Issues","text":"<p>The cryptographic security aspect of SSL is entirely based on trust. Mid-2013, there were about 650 Certificate Authorities. Every one of these authorities may pose as the \"weakest link\", and therefore the security of your SSL certificate only goes as far as your trust in it's CA.</p> <p>The <code>SSLCertificateChainFile</code>  directive has been removed from the LPIC-2 objectives. This directive is good to know nevertheless. It is an addition to the <code>SSLCertificateFile</code> and <code>SSLCertificateKeyFile</code> directives. The impact of self signed certificates for HTTPS sessions has been pointed out earlier. But even if you send a CSR to a known CA and receive a validated certificate in return, set up your server correctly using this certificate and the correct key file used to generate the CSR, this does not mean every browser will validate a session using this certificate as valid. This is often due to the involved CA having signed the CSR using a certificate that is not known to your browser. This might for instance be the case if the signing certificate is newer than your browser. But also because many CA's offer different types of certificates from their product portfolio. Browsers recognize the validity of HTTPS certificates based on the availability of so called root-certificates. These could be seen as the top level within the certificate chain. The CSR's on the other hand are often signed using a so called intermediate certificate. These intermediate certificates are relatable to the root certificate, but exist on a lower level in the certificate chain. To restrict the amount of certificates being shipped with browser software, not all certificates being used to sign CSR's are included by default . This could result in browser warnings about an incomplete certificate chain. To remedy these warnings (actually errors) , one or more intermediate certificates may be needed to reassemble the certificate chain for completeness. In order to facilitate this, CA's using intermediate certificates usually offer these intermediate certificates for download. The website of the CA and/or the email holding the signed certificate information should point to the appropriate intermediate certificate(s). The different levels are often referred to as G*n*-level certificates, where n represents a certain number. These intermediate certicates fill the gap between your signed certificate, and the root certificates known to all major browsers. By using the <code>SSLCertificateChainFile</code> directive, you may point Apache to a file that holds two or more concatenated certificates. By concatenating the missing certificates in the right order, the certificate chain gap will be closed and the certificate chain will be complete again.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.2/#disabling-of-insecure-protocols-and-ciphers","title":"Disabling of insecure protocols and ciphers","text":"<p>When Apache is configured as a Secure Server to serve content via the HTTPS protocol, the client and server negotiate upon encryption initiation which ciphers can be used to secure the connection.

By setting the <code>SSLHonorCipherOrder</code> directive to a value of <code>on</code>, the server will honor the order of ciphers as specified by the <code>SSLCipherSuite</code> directive. Otherwise, the client will have the upper hand when deciding which ciphers will be used. This secure channel then is used to transmit the encryption keys that will be used to secure the communication from here on forward. Those encryption keys must also be in a cipher format that both the server and client can handle. As is often the case, trade-offs have to be made between compatibility and security. Maximizing the amount of ciphers offered (and therefore browser compatibility) also increases the possibility that one or more of the ciphers in use may be susceptible to attack vectors. The term 'weak ciphers' is often used to refer to these vulnerable encryption algorithms. The list of (de)recommended ciphers, is heavily dependant on the publication of known vulnerabilities to abuse these ciphers. This leads to opinions that may change over time. It is therefore recommended to stay up to date about known vulnerabilities. Currently, use of so called Cipher Block Code ciphers is not recommended. These ciphers may be identified by a \"CBC\" part in their name. Neither is Arcfour (or RC4 in short) a recommended cipher to be used. As far as protocols go, SSL v2 and SSL v3 are known to be vulnerable to a plethora of attack vectors. TLS v1.0 and v1.1 also have their weaknesses. TLS v1.2 is currently the recommended protocol to use if security is a concern. With TLS v1.3 being almost visible on the horizon. Apache allows for configuration of the ciphers being offered to clients. By using the following directives, the list of ciphers that Apache offers to client software can be limited:</p> <pre><code>    SSLCipherSuite\n    SSLProtocol\n</code></pre> <p>The following section shows an example configuration on how these directives may be used. The <code>SSLCipherSuite</code> is configured to use strong ciphersuites only, while explicitly disabling <code>RC4</code>. The <code>SSLProtocol</code> directive disables support for <code>All</code> protocols, while explicitly enabling <code>TLSv1.2</code> support. The order in which the ciphers should be evaluated for mutual support by both the server and the client is determined by the server through use of the <code>SSLHonorCipherOrder</code> directive. Finally, the <code>SSLCompression</code> directive is configured to disable SSL/TLS compression. Disabling this compression mitigates the known CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) attack vector.</p> <pre><code>    SSLCipherSuite EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:!RC4\n    SSLProtocol -All +TLSv1.2\n    SSLHonorCipherOrder On\n    SSLCompression Off\n</code></pre> <p>From Apache 2.4 on, <code>mod_ssl</code> dropped support for SSLv2. Only SSLv3 and TLS are supported. Be aware that support for recent TLS versions depends on the availability of recent OpenSSL libraries.</p> <p>A good reference before configuring a secure Apache server, is the Mozilla TLS Server project at Github. This website has example configuration strings for various major HTTP servers, including Apache. The project team members should keep the example configurations up to date according to the latest recommendations. Another good reference is https://cipherli.st. This website also offers example configurations.</p> <p>Regarding every example configuration is it always important not to copy/paste configurations without validating the content. As explained earlier, a trade-off has to be made in most cases. Configuring Apache to strictly serve a modern cipher like TLS 1.2 will mitigate most known attack vectors in regards to SSL and TLS connections. But not every browser on every operating system will be able to adhere to this requirement. The adoption of TLS v1.2 in client software requires the availability of recent SSL libraries. Not all software vendors keep these libraries on track. The trade-off here is therefore security in favor of compatibility. Using older ciphers like SSL v2 and SSL v3 will probably increase the chances of encrypted connections being vulnerable to known attacks. But at the same time this will maximize the compatibility of clients that will be able to set up these connections. Another trade off.</p> <p>Apart from explicitly specifying which protocols and ciphers _can_ be used, the preference for using a certain protocol or cipher may vary. The order in which the directives are specified has influence, but gives no guarantees. Servers and clients often use a technique called opportunistic encryption to decide which of the protocols and ciphers will be used. At the same time, it is possible for client software to specify exactly what protocol and ciphers should be used. Depending on the server configuration, the server will respect these demands by the client. It is this very functionality that is the basis for a category of known attacks called downgrade attacks.</p> <p>After having set up your server, it is regarded as a best practice to periodicly scan the system for known vulnerabilities. This can be done in multiple ways. An easy way is to use a public web service like Qualys SSLabs: https://ssllabs.com. The output will show you in detail whether and if so, which weak protocols and/or ciphers were detected.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.3/","title":"Implementing Squid as a caching proxy (208.3)","text":""},{"location":"lpic2.208.3/#implementing-squid-as-a-caching-proxy-2083","title":"Implementing Squid as a caching proxy (208.3)","text":"<p>Candidates should be able to install and configure a proxy server, including access policies, authentication and resource usage.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.3/#key-knowledge-areas","title":"Key Knowledge Areas","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Squid 3.x configuration files, terms and utilities</p> </li> <li> <p>Access restriction methods</p> </li> <li> <p>Client user authentication methods</p> </li> <li> <p>Layout and content of ACL in the Squid configuration files</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.3/#terms-and-utilities","title":"Terms and utilities:","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>squid.conf</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>acl</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>http_access</code></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.3/#web-caches","title":"Web-caches","text":"<p>A web-cache, also known as an http proxy, is web-cache http proxy used to reduce bandwidth demands and often allows for finer-grained access control.

FTP gopher <code>squid</code> handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process. <code>squid</code> keeps meta data and, especially, hot objects cached in RAM, it caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups and implements negative caching of failed requests. <code>squid</code> also supports SSL, extensive access controls and full request squidSSL logging. By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, <code>squid</code> caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.</p> <p><code>squid</code> can be used for a number of things, including bandwidth saving, handling traffic spikes and caching sites that are occasionally unavailable. <code>squid</code> can also be used for load balancing. Essentially, the first time <code>squid</code> receives a request from a browser, it acts as an intermediary and passes the request on to the server. <code>squid</code> then saves a copy of the object. If no other clients request the same object, no benefit will be gained. However, if multiple clients request the object before it expires from the cache, <code>squid</code> can speed up transactions and save bandwidth. If you've ever needed a document from a slow site, say one located in another country or hosted on a slow connection, or both, you will notice the benefit of having a document cached. The first request may be slower than molasses, but the next request for the same document will be much faster, and the originating server's load will be lightened.</p> <p><code>squid</code> consists of a main server program <code>squid</code>, a Domain Name System lookup program <code>dnsserver</code>, some optional programs for rewriting requests and performing authentication, and some management and client tools. When <code>squid</code> starts up, it spawns a configurable number of <code>dnsserver</code> processes, each of which can perform a single, blocking Domain Name System (DNS) lookup. This reduces the amount of time the cache waits for DNS lookups.</p> <p><code>squid</code> is normally obtained in source code format. On most systems a simple <code>make install</code> will suffice. After that, you will also have a set of configuration files. In most distributions all the squid configuration files are, by default, kept in the directory <code>/usr/local/squid/etc</code>. However, the location may vary, depending on the style and habits of your distribution. The Debian packages, for example, place the configuration files in <code>/etc</code>, which is the normal home directory for <code>.conf</code> files. Though there is more than one file in this directory, only one file is important to most administrators, namely the <code>squid.conf</code> file. There are just about 125 option tags in this file but only eight options are really needed to get <code>squid</code> up and running. The other options just give you additional flexibility.</p> <p><code>squid</code> assumes that you wish to use the default value if there is no occurrence of a tag in the <code>squid.conf</code> file. Theoretically, you could even run <code>squid</code> with a zero length configuration file. However, you will need to change at least one part of the configuration file, i.e. the default <code>squid.conf</code> denies access to all browsers. You will need to edit the Access Control Lists to allow your clients to use the <code>squid</code> proxy. The most basic way to perform access control is to use the <code>http_access</code> option (see below).</p> <p><code>http_port</code></p> <ul> <li>This option determines on which port(s) <code>squid</code> will listen     squidhttp_port for requests.

This     option can have four parameters:</p> <pre><code>    cache_dir /usr/local/squid/cache/ 100 16 256\n</code></pre> <p>The first option determines in which directory the cache should be maintained. The next option is a size value in Megabytes where the default is 100 Megabytes. <code>squid</code> will store up to that amount of data in the specified directory. The next two options will set the number of subdirectories (first and second tier) to create in this directory. <code>squid</code> creates a large number of directories and stores just a few files in each of them in an attempt to speed up disk access (finding the correct entry in a directory with one million files in it is not efficient: it's better to split the files up into lots of smaller sets of files).</p> </li> </ul> <p><code>http_access</code>; <code>acl</code></p> <ul> <li> <p>The basic syntax of the option is     <code>http_access allow|deny [!]aclname</code>. squidhttp_access If you want     to provide access to an internal network, and deny access to anyone     else, your options might look like this:</p> <pre><code>    acl home src 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0\n    http_access allow home\n</code></pre> <p>The first line sets up an Access Control List class called \"home\" of an internal network range of ip addresses. The second line allows access to that range of ip addresses. Assuming it's the final line in the access list, all other clients will be denied. See also the section on acl.</p> <p>::: {.tip} Note that <code>squid</code>'s default behavior is to do the opposite of your last access line if it can't find a matching entry. For example, if the last line is set to \"allow\" access for a certain set of network addresses, then <code>squid</code> will deny any client that doesn't match any of its rules.

Authentication squidauthentication can be done on various levels, e.g. network or user.</p> <p>Browsers are capable to send the user's authentication credentials using a special \"authorization request header\". This works as follows. If <code>squid</code> gets a request, given there was an <code>http_access</code> rule list that points to a <code>proxy_auth</code> ACL, <code>squid</code> looks for an authorization header. If the header is present, <code>squid</code> decodes it and extracts a username and password. If the header is missing, <code>squid</code> returns an HTTP reply with status 407 (Proxy Authentication Required). The user agent (browser) receives the 407 reply and then prompts the user to enter a name and password. The name and password are encoded, and sent in the authorization header for subsequent requests to the proxy.</p> <p>Authentication is actually performed outside of the main <code>squid</code> process. When <code>squid</code> starts, it spawns a number of authentication subprocesses. These processes read usernames and passwords on <code>stdin</code> and reply with <code>OK</code> or <code>ERR</code> on <code>stdout</code>. This technique allows you to use a number of different authentication schemes.

In most cases the feature to <code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code> will be <code>http_access</code>, which allows or denies a web browsers access to the web-cache. The same principles apply to the other options, such as <code>icp_access</code> (Internet Cache Protocol).</p> <p>To determine whether a resource (e.g. a user) has access to the web-cache, <code>squid</code> works its way through the <code>http_access</code> list from top to bottom.

It doesn't work using threads as most of the other webserver software does but it's using an event driven (asynchronous) architecture. It has a small footprint and performs very well under load with predictable usage of resources. This predictable performance and small memory footprint makes Nginx interesting in both small and large environments. Nginx is distributed as Open Source software. There is also 'Nginx Plus', which is the commercial edition. This book will focus on the Open Source edition.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.4/#reverse-proxy","title":"Reverse Proxy","text":"<p>A proxy server is a go-between or intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate back-end server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.</p> <p>Common uses for a reverse proxy server include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Load balancing -- A reverse proxy server can act as a \"traffic cop,\"     sitting in front of your back-end servers and distributing client     requests across a group of servers in a manner that maximizes speed     and capacity utilization while ensuring no server is overloaded,     which can degrade performance. If a server goes down, the load     balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Web acceleration -- Reverse proxies can compress inbound and     outbound data, as well as cache commonly requested content, both of     which speed up the flow of traffic between clients and servers. They     can also perform additional tasks such as SSL encryption to take     load off of your web servers, thereby boosting their performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security and anonymity -- By intercepting requests headed for your     back-end servers, a reverse proxy server protects their identities     and acts as an additional defense against security attacks. It also     ensures that multiple servers can be accessed from a single record     locater or URL regardless of the structure of your local area     network.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Using Nginx as reverse HTTP proxy is not hard to configure. A very basic reverse proxy setup might look like this:</p> <pre><code>location / {\n      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n      proxy_set_header Host      $host;\n      proxy_pass       http://localhost:8000;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example all requests received by Nginx, depending on the configuration of the server parameters in <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>, are forwarded to an HTTP server running on localhost and listening on port 8000. The Nginx configuration file looks like this:</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen   80;\n\n    root /var/www/; \n    index index.php index.html index.htm;\n\n    server_name example.com www.example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;\n    }\n\n    location ~ \\.php$ {    \n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;\n    }\n\n    location ~ /\\.ht {\n        deny all;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The line starting with <code>location  ~ /\\.ht</code> is added to prevent Nginx of displaying the content of Apache's .htaccess files. The try_files line is used to attempt to serve whatever page the visitor requests. If nginx is unable, then the file is passed to the proxy.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.208.4/#basic-web-server","title":"Basic Web Server","text":"<p>The default location for the configuration file in Nginx is <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>.</p> <p>A basic Nginx configuration, able to serve html files, looks like this:</p> <pre><code>server {\n    # This will listen on all interfaces, you can instead choose a specific IP\n    # such as listen x.x.x.x:80;  \n    listen 80;\n\n    # Here you can set a server name, you can use wildcards such as *.example.com\n    # however remember if you use server_name *.example.com; You'll only match subdomains\n    # to match both subdomains and the main domain use both example.com and *.example.com\n    server_name example.com www.example.com;\n\n    # It is best to place the root of the server block at the server level, and not the location level\n    # any location block path will be relative to this root. \n    root /usr/local/www/example.com;\n\n    # Access and error logging.

If this is set to yes (unix password sync = yes), the     program specified in the <code>passwd</code> program parameter is called AS     ROOT - to allow the new UNIX password to be set without access to     the old UNIX password (as the SMB password change code has no access     to the old cleartext password).</li> </ul> <p>passdb backend</p> <ul> <li> <p>This option determines what account/password backend is used.

The most common usage is to map usernames used on DOS or     Windows machines to those used on the UNIX system. Another usage is     to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more     easily share files. The username map is a file where each line     should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a \"=\"     followed by a space-delimited list of usernames on the right. Quotes     must be used to specify a username that includes a space. The list     of usernames on the right may contain names of the form \\@group in     which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The     special client name \"*\" is a wildcard and can be used to match     unknown names to a known user. Each line of the map file may be up     to 1023 characters long. If a line begins with a \"!\" then the     processing will stop at that point if it matches a name. This is     useful for lines used before a wildcard otherwise names will still     be mapped to the one using the wildcard.</p> <p>Here is an example:</p> <pre><code>    username map = /usr/local/samba/private/usermap.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Example content of <code>usermap.txt</code>:</p> <pre><code>    root = administraor admin\n    nobody = guest pcguest smbguest\n    alice.jones = alice\n    readonly = glen fred terry sarah\n    lachlan = \"Lachlan Smith\"\n    users = @sales\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p>guest ok</p> <ul> <li>This parameter configures guest access for a service.</li> </ul> <p>map to guest</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is guest access is enabled this option determines what sessions are     mapped to guest access.

More about NFS version 4 and differences between earlier versions is covered in NFS protocol versions.</p> <p>Guessable file handles.</p> <p>One of the ways to break in a NFS server is to guess so-called file-handles. The old (32-bit) file-handles (used in NFS version 2) were rather easy to guess. NFSfile handles Version 3 of the NFS protocol offers improved security by using 64-bit file-handles that are considerably harder to guess.</p> <p>Version 4 security enhancements.</p> <p>Version 4 of the NFS protocol defines encrypted connections. When the connection is encrypted, getting information by sniffing is made much harder or even impossible.</p> <p>Overview of NFS components </p> <p>table_title provides an overview of the most important files and software related to NFS.</p> program or file description The kernel provides NFS support <code>portmap</code> handles RPC requests <code>rpc.nfsd</code> NFS server control (kernel space) or software (user space) <code>rpc.mountd</code> handles incoming (un)mount requests <code>/etc/exports</code> defines which filesystems are exported <code>exportfs</code> command (un)exports filesystems <code>showmount --exports</code> shows current exports The <code>rpcinfo</code> command reports RPC information The <code>nfsstat</code> command reports NFS statistics <code>showmount --all</code> shows active mounts to me (this host) `mount -t nfs mounts a remote filesystem remote:/there /here` <code>umount -t nfs -a</code> unmounts all remote filesystems"},{"location":"lpic2.209.2/#nfs-protocol-versions","title":"NFS protocol versions","text":"<p>Currently, there are a lot of changes in the NFS protocol that can affect the way the system is set up. </p> Protocol version Current status kernel or user space udp or tcp transport 1 never released 2 becoming obsolete user, kernel udp, some tcp impl. exist 3 new standard kernel udp, tcp: under development 4 new standard kernel tcp                           performance improvements;   mandates strong security;   stateful protocol <p>The trends that can be seen in this table  are: kernel space instead of user space and tcp instead of udp.</p> <p>A note on the transport protocol.</p> <p>Connections over <code>tcp</code> (NFS v3, v4, some v2) are considered better than connections over <code>udp</code> (NFS v2, v3).

Possible log facilities include auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news, ntp, security, syslog, user, uucp, and local0 through local7. Not all of these facilities are available on all systems, and there may be other facilities available on other systems.

Networks using IPv6 often use the \"Neighbor Discovery Protocol\" to obtain an IP address that is valid for the network. In Linux, this protocol is handled by the \"Router Advertisement\" (<code>radvd</code>) daemon.</p> <p>The process for IPv6 address assignment works a bit different from IPv4 networks, because IPv6 hosts always assign link-local addresses for IPv6-enabled interfaces automatically, without any help from external hosts. NDP builds upon this stateless autoconfiguration process by distributing \"prefixes\" instead of addresses. Using the prefix (which is basically the network part of an IP address) obtained through NDP, hosts can assign valid IPv6 addresses to themselves. So in contrast with the DHCP daemon on IPv4 networks, NDP has no concept of IP pools and leases.</p> <p>Instead of requesting an address, clients send \"router sollicitation\" requests to obtain a valid IPv6 prefix. The <code>radvd</code> daemon responds to these requests with router advertisement messages. These messages contain the routing prefix used on the link, the maximum transmission unit (MTU), and the address of the responsible default router.</p> <p>The <code>radvd</code> daemon is configured by <code>/etc/radvd.conf</code>, which has to contain at least the interface the daemon should listen on and the prefix it has to serve. Additionally, <code>radvd</code> can periodically re-advertise its prefixes to hosts on the same network. If you wish, you can also configure the lifetime of the IPv6 addresses that hosts configure for themselves.</p> <p>A typical <code>radvd.conf</code> would look similar to the following:</p> <pre><code>interface eth0 { \n        AdvSendAdvert on;\n        MinRtrAdvInterval 3; \n        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;\n        prefix 2001:0db8:0100:f101::/64 { \n                AdvOnLink on; \n                AdvAutonomous on; \n                AdvRouterAddr on; \n        };\n};\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lpic2.210.2/","title":"PAM authentication (210.2)","text":""},{"location":"lpic2.210.2/#pam-authentication-2102","title":"PAM authentication (210.2)","text":"<p>The candidate should be able to configure PAM to support authentication using various available methods.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.210.2/#key-knowledge-areas","title":"Key Knowledge Areas","text":"<ul> <li> <p>PAM configuration files, terms and utilities</p> </li> <li> <p>passwd and shadow passwords</p> </li> <li> <p>basic SSSD functionality for LDAP authentication</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.210.2/#terms-and-utilities","title":"Terms and Utilities","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>/etc/pam.d</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>pam.conf</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>nsswitch.conf</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>pam_unix, pam_cracklib, pam_limits, pam_listfile</code></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"lpic2.210.2/#what-is-pam","title":"What is PAM?","text":"<p>PAM is the acronym for Pluggable Authentication Modules.

LDAPRFC 2116</p> <p>The reason for a lightweight version is that DAP was rather heavy on processor load, thereby asking for more than the processors could provide at the time. LDAP is described in RFC 2251. LDAPRFC 2251</p> <p>The LDAP project was started at the University of Michigan, but, as can be read on their site, is no longer maintained there. For current information, the University of Michigan site points visitors to the OpenLDAP site instead.</p> <p>The type of information best suited for storage in a directory is information with a low mutation grade. The reason for this is that directories can not compete with RDBM systems because they are only optimized for read access. So then, what do we store in a directory? Typically, LDAP directories contain employee data such as surname, christian name, address, phone number, department, social security number, E-mail address. Alternatively, directories might store newsletters for everyone to read, description of company policies and procedures, templates supporting the house style of documents.</p> <p>LDAP is a client/server system. The server can use a variety of databases to store a directory, each optimized for quick and copious read operations. When an LDAP client application connects to an LDAP server, it can either query a directory or attempt to modify it. In the event of a query, the server either answers the query locally, or it can refer the querent to an LDAP server which does have the answer. If the client application is attempting to modify information within an LDAP directory, the server verifies that the user has permission to make the change and then adds or updates the information.</p> <p>entry</p> <ul> <li>A single unit within an LDAP directory.

For example, an     organization could be represented as an LDAP entry. Attributes     associated with the organization might be its fax number, its     address, and so on. People can also be represented as entries in the     LDAP directory. Common attributes for people include the person's     telephone number and email address.</p> <p>Some attributes are required, while other attributes are optional. An objectclass definition sets which attributes are required and which are not for each entry.

A blank line indicates the end of an entry. A line may be broken and continued (folded) by indenting the continued portion of the line. For example, the following two statements are identical:</p> <pre><code>    dn: cn=some_example_user,dc=example,dc=com\n    dn: cn=some_e\n     xample_user,\n     dc=example,d\n     c=com\n</code></pre> <p>Note All <code>&lt;attrtype&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;attrvalue&gt;</code> pairs must be defined in a corresponding schema file to use this information.</p> <p>Any value enclosed within a <code>&lt;</code> and a <code>&gt;</code> is a variable and can be set whenever a new LDAP entry is created.

The responsibility of the client is to transfer the message to one or more SMTP servers, or to report a failure to do so.</p> <p>The means by which an e-mail message is presented to an SMTP client, and how the domain name to transfer the message to is determined, is a local matter that will not be addressed here.</p> <p>Detailed information can be found at:RFC5321.</p> <p>For demonstration and testing purposes a plain text SMTP session can be initiated with <code>telnet</code>, <code>nc</code> or <code>ncat</code>: nc ncat telnet</p> <pre><code>    telnet mx1.unix.nl 25\n    Connected to mx1.unix.nl (213.154.248.146).\n    Escape character is '^]'.\n    220 mx1.unix.nl ESMTP Exim 4.63 Thu, 12 Aug 2010 08:50:30 +0200\n    ehlo sue.nl\n    250-mx1.unix.nl Hello mx1.unix.nl [81.23.226.83]\n    250-SIZE 52428800\n    250-PIPELINING\n    250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN\n    250-STARTTLS\n    250 HELP\n</code></pre> <p>When using <code>nc</code> or <code>ncat</code> when performing the commands above, an additional <code>Enter</code> keystroke may be necessary. This is due to the differences in return characters that may exist between <code>telnet</code> and other, similar tools.</p> <p>With <code>telnet &lt;smtp servername&gt;              25</code> initial contact with the SMTP server is established. In the example above mx1.unix.nl was used as the server. The server responds with the maximum message size, the pipelining, and the authentication capabilities of the server, in this case AUTH PLAIN LOGIN. The server is also able to use STARTTLS, and HELP.</p> <ul> <li> <p>SIZE: when the size of the message the client wishes to send exceeds     the set limit, the SMTP transaction will be aborted with an ERROR     code pipelining. Also, when enabled, an SMTP client can transmit a     group of SMTP commands (e.g., RSET, MAIL FROM:, RCPT TO:) without     waiting for a response from the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>AUTH PLAIN LOGIN: the SMTP server is capable of handling a plain     password/username authentication. This can be handy for mobile     devices using the SMTP server while originating from different IP     addresses.</p> </li> <li> <p>STARTTLS: The SMTP protocol itself doesn't include any form of     encryption. With STARTTLS the communciation can be encrypted using     certificates. This is fully described in RFC 3207.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Since we have established the initial connection we can now proceed:</p> <pre><code>    mail from: nonexistent@sue.nl\n    250 OK\n    rcpt to: nonexistent@unix.nl\n    250 Accepted\n</code></pre> <p>The server responds with \"250 OK\" but when, for example, the \"MAIL FROM:\" command is followed by a misformatted or incomplete email address the server responds with \"501: sender address must contain domain\" or a similar error. With \"RCPT TO: \\&lt;email address&gt;\" the destination of the message is given. If the recipient's address is accepted the server responds with: \"250 Accepted\".</p> <p>Now the mail serverknows who we are and to whom we wish to transmit a message. The email client also knows what the SMTP server is capable of. We then proceed with the transmission:</p> <pre><code>    data\n    354 Enter message, ending with \".\" on a line by itself\n    mail from: Aiu &lt;nonexistent@sue.nl&gt;\n    From: &lt;nonexistent@sue.nl&gt;\n    To: Info &lt;nonexistent@unix.nl&gt;\n    Subject: Demo messages\n    Date: 12-02-2010 08:53:00\n    MesssageID: 31231233@sue.nl\n    This is a demonstration mesage.\n    .\n    250 OK id=1OjReS-0005kT-Jj\n    quit\n</code></pre> <p>With the DATA command we proceed with the contents of the message. The server responds with: \"354 Enter message, ending with \\\".\\\" on a line by itself\".</p> <p>Then the message contents is entered, starting with the message headers. These headers are used by the email client. In the example the commands Mail From:, To:, Subject:, Date: and MessageID: are used. MessageID: is a unique identifier generated by the SMTP client. These headers are required as described in RFC 5322.</p> <p>After the headers have been entered, a blank line indicates that the actual text of the message commences. The message ends, as the DATA command response has indicated, with a \".\" (without the quotes) on a line by itself. The server responds with: \"250 OK id=1OjReS-0005kT-Jj\". The id is a unique SMTP server identifier and can be used for troubleshooting.</p> <p>Note To fight spam, some SMTP servers can check whether a message is RFC 5322 compliant. Regular SMTP clients are RFC 5322 compliant, but spammers often use not so regular SMTP clients and hence could send malformed messages.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.211.1/#sendmail","title":"Sendmail","text":"<p>Basic sendmail configuration steps are: sendmail</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download Sendmail</p> </li> <li> <p>Set up Sendmail</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure Sendmail</p> </li> <li> <p>Build the Sendmail User Table</p> </li> <li> <p>Add your domain names to Sendmail</p> </li> <li> <p>Test your configuration file</p> </li> </ol> <p>Basic configuration of sendmail is described at: Sendmail basic installation.</p> <p>An installation and operation guide for sendmail 8.12 can be found at: Sendmail installation and operation guide.</p> <p>Sendmail can either be built from source or installed as sendmail binaries.

It focusses on speed, ease of administration and security. The author of the software, Wietse Venema, was dependant on long computer calculations during his study. It was during that time that he developed a habit of creating software that would be as fault-free and fault-resistant as possible. Only if he could trust the software to run for two weeks straight without errors, there would be no necessity to sleep on the floor for those two weeks while babysitting it. This coding habit stuck with the author for the years to come. When the Postfix program was first written, it was done with the same habit as those earlier study assignments. This habit then became a coding philosophy. By writing the code in a structured manner, only adding neccessary bits and making sure execution flows as efficient as possible, the resulting software became fast, easy to administer and secure. Today, Postfix is still under active development. Many people have contributed to it, and many still do. Despite this common effort, the original author still assures that only necessary code gets added. And that it is added in a way that does not interfere with the philosophy that has been part of Postfix from the start. This approach, in combination with the way that Postfix consists of various small programs working together instead of one big program, makes Postfix a very attractive alternative to other MTA solutions.</p> <p>At the time of writing Postfix version 3.1 is the latest stable release. Postfix version 3.2 is (still) considered experimental. Experimental Postfix releases can be recognized by their names. These will carry a date in them. An example of an experimental release is the following tarball: <code>postfix-3.2-20161204.tar.gz</code>. Stable Postfix versions only show (major and minor) version numbers without the date at the end. Due to its wide adoption, most Linux distributions offer Postfix. However there is a wide variety in versions being deployed. According to its website http://www.postfix.org, versions prior to Postfix 2.10 are End-Of-Support (EOS). CentOS 6.8 still ships with Postfix 2.6 though. Debian 7 did not get beyond Postfix 2.9. More recent Linux distribution versions like CentOS 7 and Debian 8 ship with Postfix &gt;2.10, while some bleeding edge Linux distribution versions offer Postfix &gt;3.1. There is absolutely no certainty that more recent versions of Postfix will have fewer bugs than older versions of Postfix. It is regarded as a 'best practice' to be aware of which version of Postfix you are exposing to the Internet, while at the same time keeping up to date about known Postfix vulnerabilities. There is no reason to restrict this best practice to Postfix alone though.</p> <p>To address the Postfix objectives that are defined for the LPIC-2 exam, the following will provide some examples. These asume you are using Postfix installed from packages on either a Debian-based or a Red Hat based Linux distribution. There may still be circumstances that require Postfix to be build from source. That subject is beyond the scope of this chapter but the topic in general is covered by LPIC objective 206.1.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.211.1/#postfix-main.cf","title":"Postfix main.cf file format","text":"<p>The default location for the postfix configuration files is <code>/etc/postfix</code>. Amongst others there are two main ones that determine Postfix behavior: <code>main.cf</code> and <code>master.cf</code>. By default, the main.cf configuration file specifies a subset of all the parameters that control the operation of the Postfix mail system. Parameters not explicitly specified are left at their default values. Refer to the <code>postconf(5)</code> manpage for a full listing of all parameters. The <code>main.cf</code> file contains useful comments as well as references to other documentation sources at the top. On Debian-based systems, the <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code> file you encounter may be a stripped-down version. The <code>/usr/share/postfix</code> directory should then contain a <code>main.cf.dist</code> file that is more elaborate. The following line count operation gives an estimate about the differences between the different <code>main.cf</code> files on a Debian-based system:</p> <pre><code>    user@debian:/usr/share/postfix$ wc -l /etc/postfix/main.cf \n    43  /etc/postfix/main.cf\n    user@debian:/usr/share/postfix$ wc -l /usr/share/postfix/main.cf*\n    18  /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.debian\n    665 /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist\n     11 /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.tls\n</code></pre> <p>The example above demonstrates that the <code>/usr/share/postfix/main.cf.dist</code> file holds more than 600 lines, whereas the default <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code> file only holds 43. Keeping the main.cf file clean and tidy is a good habit. It is also a good habit to use a pager to read through the more elaborate <code>main.cf.dist</code> file on Debian-based systems. Red Hat based systems keep well documented configuration files within the <code>/etc/postfix</code> directory.</p> <p>By default, postfix will only read configuration files from the <code>/etc/postfix</code> directory. Other configuration directories may be specified by using the <code>alternate_config_directories</code> directive in <code>/etc/postfix/main.cf</code>. Red Hat based distributions may have <code>/etc/postfix/dynamicmaps.cf.d</code> and <code>/etc/postfix/postfix-files.d</code> directories. These directories exist to ease the life of the Postfix package creators and should be left alone unless you are really sure about what you are doing.</p> <p>Note The postfix configuration directory <code>/etc/postfix</code> is \"hard-coded\" in compilation. Chapter 4.6 of the following document explains how to change this value when building Postfix from source: Postfix Installation From Source Code</p> <p>The general format of the main.cf file is as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each logical line is in the form <code>parameter = value</code>.

The remainder of that document is a description of all Postfix configuration parameters. Default values are shown after the parameter name in parentheses. These default values can also be looked up with the <code>sudo /usr/sbin/postconf -d</code> command. Beware though, since this command will produce 877 lines of output on a Postfix 3.1 instance. Because it is an administrative command and usually located within <code>/usr/sbin</code>, <code>sudo</code> or a shell with root privileges should be used to invoke this command.</p> <p>One of the \"best practices\" to use with Postfix is to disable the <code>SMTP VRFY</code> command on a publicly accessible mail server. This VeRiFY command can be abused by an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts or email adddresses as follows:</p> <pre><code>    user@mailserver:~$ telnet mailserver 25\n    Trying ::1...\n    Connected to mailserver.\n    Escape character is '^]'.\n    220 localhost ESMTP Postfix (Linux/GNU)\n    EHLO localhost\n    250-localhost\n    250-PIPELINING\n    250-SIZE 10240000\n    250-VRFY\n    250-ETRN\n    250-STARTTLS\n    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n    250-8BITMIME\n    250 DSN\n    VRFY root\n    252 2.0.0 root\n    VRFY wodan\n    550 5.1.1 &lt;wodan&gt;: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table\n    VRFY postfix\n    252 2.0.0 postfix\n</code></pre> <p>The 200-category response codes expose valid recipients. Just like HTTP servers do, a SMTP server can respond with status codes. It is recommended to be familiar with the most common response codes. This will aid when debugging system performance or issues. It is usually not necessary to know the difference between 220 and 250 at first sight. But the difference between 2xx and 5xx status codes should be noticable and familiar. The VRFY command is enabled on Postfix by default. By enabling or adding the following line to <code>main.cf</code> the VRFY feature is disabled:</p> <pre><code>    disable_vrfy_command = yes\n</code></pre> <p>Let's try the <code>VRFY root</code> command from above again after both having disabled the VRFY command and having reloaded Postfix:</p> <pre><code>    user@mailserver:~$ telnet mailserver 25\n    Trying ::1...\n    Connected to localhost.\n    Escape character is '^]'.\n    220 localhost ESMTP Postfix (Linux/GNU)\n    EHLO localhost\n    250-localhost\n    250-PIPELINING\n    250-SIZE 10240000\n    250-ETRN\n    250-STARTTLS\n    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n    250-8BITMIME\n    250 DSN\n    VRFY root\n    502 5.5.1 VRFY command is disabled\n    VRFY wodan\n    502 5.5.1 VRFY command is disabled\n    VRFY postfix\n    502 5.5.1 VRFY command is disabled\n</code></pre> <p>By disabling the possibility to distinguish between valid (2xx) and invalid (5xx) email recipients, the Internet has become a safer place.</p> <p>postfix The Postfix developers recommend to change no more than 2-3 parameters at a time, and test if Postfix still works after every change. After making changes to <code>main.cf</code> you need to reload postfix.

The SMTP protocol is similar to the HTTP protocol in that both protocols use plain text network commands. This comes in handy when debugging, because it allows for command execution through telnet- or netcat-like software. But it does not come in handy when transferring sensitive information across a range of systems. Due to the nature of the SMTP protocol, multiple machines may be involved to transfer an e-mail message from the source to the final destination. And there is no way of excluding the possibility that a message has been altered during transfer. This is where encryption comes in. By using encrypted communication, at least some form of confidentiality and authenticity can be added to SMTP transactions. Just like Apache needs to be set up properly for HTTPS transactions, Postfix needs to be configured for use with TLS as well. Unlike Apache, we leave out the SSL acronym and only refer to TLS for Postfix. The following paragraphs will explain more about TLS-specific Postfix directives and about configuring Postfix for use with TLS.</p> <p>At the time of writing, TLSv1.3 is the latest TLS version. TLSv1.3 has reached DRAFT status, and it will be a matter of time before it hits the streets. There will be some noteworthy changes between TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. Up to TLSv1.2, a ciphersuite consisted of an authentication algorithm, an encryption algorithm, a message digest algorithm and a key exchange algorithm. These four algorithms work together and are defined by their acronyms. From TLSv1.3 onward, the ciphersuite will consist of only the encryption and message authentication algorithm.</p> <p>The following paragraphs are ment to assist you in getting Postfix with TLS up and running. Encryption is an ever expanding subject, and it is recommended to take the time to read and understand the available documentation with regard to Postfix and the (proper) use of TLS. Postfix comes with extensive documentation that may be found within the <code>/usr/share/doc/postfix</code> directory (on Debian-based systems, you might have to install the <code>postfix-doc</code> package for completeness as is explained on the bottom of this page). The <code>TLS_README</code> document is definitely worth reading. It can be viewed using a pager like <code>less</code> or first expanded using a utility like <code>zcat</code> if the file is compressed. The <code>TLS_README.txt</code> document is also available on the Postix website http://www.postfix.org.</p> <p>openssl When creating a keypair for use with Apache, it may be preferred to use an encrypted private key. An encrypted key needs to be decrypted using a password before it can be used. OpenSSL will encrypt the private key during creation by default, unless specified otherwise. Postfix requires the private key used for TLS encrypted communication to be unencrypted, in other words without a password. A private key may be stripped from its password by reading, importing and exporting the key with OpenSSL. In the following example though, the <code>-nodes</code> option is used with OpenSSL during creation time of the key. This will prevent OpenSSL from encrypting the private key in the first place.</p> <pre><code>    sudo openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \\\n    -keyout postfixkey.pem -out postfixcert.pem \\\n    -days 356\n</code></pre> <p>The self-signed certificate and private key created with the one-liner above can be used for postfix. Postfix demands the private key file is owned by, and readable only by root. The certificate file may be world-readable. Because the example above uses the RSA algorithm, the following directives are used to refer to these files:</p> <pre><code>    smtpd_tls_cert_file=postfixcert.pem\n    smtpd_tls_key_file=postfixkey.pem\n</code></pre> <p>Note smtpd_tls smtp_tls When declaring these directives, take special care to differentiate between <code>smtpd_tls_</code> directives and <code>smtp_tls</code> directives. The latter are used for client authentication.</p> <p>The certificate file must be in the PEM-format. This is the OpenSSL standard export format, so no additional flags should be required. In the example above, the RSA algorithm is used. Instead of RSA, DSA could also be used as the encryption algorithm. When using the DSA algorithm, the key needs to be generated using the <code>-t dsa</code> option and the directives for the certificate file and key slightly differ from their RSA counterparts:</p> <pre><code>    smtpd_tls_dcert_file=postfixcert.pem\n    smtpd_tls_dkey_file=postfixkey.pem\n</code></pre> <p>ECDSA is another valid encryption algorithm for use with Postfix. But because many mailservers still use OpenSSL 0.9.8 versions that lack the proper ECDSA implementation, the use of ECDSA for Postfix with TLS is currently not recommended. Currently RSA is the recommended encryption algorithm to use with TLS for Postfix. However if you do want to use ECDSA keys, the key must be generated using the <code>-t ecdsa</code> option and the certificate and key files have to be specified using the following directives:</p> <pre><code>    smtpd_tls_eccert_file=postfixcert.pem\n    smtpd_tls_eckey_file=postfixkey.pem\n</code></pre> <p>certificateself-signed CSR CA The OpenSSL example above creates a self-signed certificate. This is a way of getting the Postfix STARTTLS functionality working \"quick and dirty\". But in terms of authenticity, self-signed certificates may not be validated by many public SMTP servers. An alternative is to create a key and CSR, and sign the CSR using your own CA. This is demonstrated in the Apache chapter. By using certificates issued by your own CA, you could let your mailservers validate each other. Yet another option is to create a key and CSR, and have the CSR signed by a public CA. That way, public SMTP servers should be able to validate the certificate offered by your Postfix server. When going this route, it may be necessary to add additional root CA references to complete the certificate chain. Additional root CA files may be configured by using either the <code>smtpd_tls_CAfile</code> or <code>smtpd_tls_CApath</code> directives. The file directive should point to a (you guessed it) file holding the necessary root CA information. When concatenating several certificates in to one file, be aware that the files are read \"bottom to top\". The <code>smtpd_tls_CApath</code> directive should point to a directory holding the necessary file(s).</p> <p>Postfix uses opportunistic encryption by default. This means that a connecting system will try to create an encrypted connection at first. However, if this fails for any reason (say, due to an invalid certificate) then the system will continue to perform all SMTP commands without encryption. This behavior is determined by the value of the <code>smtpd_tls_security_level</code> directive. By changing the value of this directive from <code>may</code> to <code>encrypt</code>, unencrypted sessions are prevented. Be aware though! This directive may prevent the Postfix server from performing any SMTP transactions anymore if TLS sessions cannot be initiated.</p> <p>Note Certificate Authority Despite all the good intentions from various public Certificate Authorities, the Certificate Authority system is kind of flawed by design. After all, ANY Certificate Authority may issue certificates for ANY service on ANY host. The chapter on DNS mentions DANE TLSA records to combat this issue. When DNSSEC has been properly configured and TLSA records are supported, it is recommended to create 301 or 311 TLSA records for a given TLS-capable Postfix server. By shifting the trust from the CA trust store with over 1300 CA root certificates to the authenticity and integrity of DNSSEC, it becomes less of a problem to depend on self-signed certificates. If multiple domains are served on the same Postfix server, it is recommended to publish a digest for every seperate domain (and therefore certificate) in DNS. The <code>smtpd_tls_support_level</code> value can be set to either <code>dane</code> or <code>dane-only</code> to handle TLSA records. Refer to the <code>TLS_README</code> file for details.</p> <p>Directives and options Postfix has been written with many \"what if...\" fall-back scenarios in mind. The result is a very resilient piece of software. Being a result of good coding practices, Postfix uses a number of mechanisms to determine if circumstances are favourable or not. If system resources become scarse, the Postfix system will adapt as is deemed suitable regarding the circumstances. When configuring Postfix to use TLS encryption, there are some directives that deserve additional attention. When configured correctly, directives should complement each others functionality. When configured inconsistently or incorrectly, directives may conflict with each others functionality. It is advised to pay additional attention to directives that are involved when configuring the allowed protocols and cipher suites. Modern Postfix versions exclude the use of SSLv2. Because version upgrades may change the default protocols and allowed cipher suites, there is no harm in configuring these yourself. By declaring the following directives in <code>main.cf</code>, these options will stay constant despite Postfix version upgrades over time.</p> <pre><code>    smtpd_tls_protocols\n    smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols\n    smtpd_tls_ciphers\n    smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers\n    smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers\n</code></pre> <p>By disabling the <code>aNULL</code> ciphers, use of anonymous ciphers is prevented. The use of anonymous ciphers is one of the fall-back scenarios that helps Postfix in providing availability, at the expense of accountability.</p> <p>As mentioned before, the TLS functionality in Postfix can be configured using the <code>smtpd_tls_security_level</code> directive. According to RFC 2487, this directive should be set to the value <code>may</code>. This will result in Postfix announcing the availability of <code>STARTTLS</code> to connecting clients, without demanding its use. If you want to enforce the use of <code>STARTTLS</code>, the value of <code>smtpd_tls_security_level</code> should be set to <code>encrypt</code> instead. Again, be aware that this may result in degraded server compatibility towards other systems. By setting the directive value to <code>none</code>, the Postfix server will refrain from announcing the <code>STARTTLS</code> method at all. When a connecting system tries to initiate <code>STARTTLS</code>, the Postfix server will reply with a <code>502 5.5.1 Error: command not implemented</code> message.</p> <p>When enabling TLS for Postfix, various additional configuration directives become available. Most directives starting with <code>smtpd_tls_</code> or <code>smtp_tls_</code> are not significant for the working of Postfix unless TLS is enabled. One of these directives is the <code>smtpd_tls_loglevel</code> directive. This directive may be configured by setting a value from <code>0-4</code>. It is not recommended to use a setting above <code>2</code>, except for debugging purposes. A value of <code>0</code> will disable logging of TLS events. A value of <code>1</code> will log a summary message on TLS handshake completion. A value of <code>2</code> will also log levels during TLS negotiation.

In larger enterprises it is often easy to identify a substantial number of hosts using TCP/IP that do not need network-layer connectivity outside the enterprise.</p> <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:</p> <pre><code>    10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)\n    172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)\n    192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)\n</code></pre> <p>We will refer to the first block as \"24-bit block\", the second as \"20-bit block\", and to the third as \"16-bit\" block. Note that when no subnetting is used (i.e. in pre- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation) the first block is nothing but a single class A network number, while the second block is a set of 16 contiguous class B network numbers and third block is a set of 256 contiguous class C network numbers.</p> <p>Even though IPv6 addresses are not likely to run out in the foreseeable future, the need for allocating private addresses has been recognized. RFC4193 describes address block fc00::/7, which is the approximate counterpart of the IPv4 private addresses described above.</p> <p>In addition to private IP addresses, IPv6 re-introduces the concept of link-local addresses, valid only for communications within the network segment (link) or the broadcast domain that the host is connected to. Routers do not forward packets with link-local addresses, because they are not guaranteed to be unique outside their network segment. In IPv4, the network range 169.254.0.0/16 was reserved for interfaces to allocate an IP address to themselves automatically. In practice, finding an IP address in this range on an interface generally means that DHCP allocation has failed, as link-local addressing is not generally used in IPv4 networks.</p> <p>In IPv6 networks, interfaces always allocate a link-local address in addition to potentially other configured or allocated IPv6 addresses. Therefore, IPv6 interfaces usually have more than one address. Link-local address are an integral part of the IPv6 protocol standard to facilitate neighbour discovery (NDP) and allocating globally unique IP addresses using DHCP6. Interfaces configured for IPv6 use part of their MAC address as a means to create a (hopefully) unique link-local address in the fe80::/64 range.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.212.1/#network-address-translation-nat","title":"Network Address Translation (NAT)","text":"<p>The figure above displays a hypothetical situation which will serve as an example in the following explanation.</p> <p>This section describes Network Address Translation (NAT), which is a technique to rewrite the source or destination address (or sometimes both) of certain IP traffic. It can be used to enable hosts using a private IP address to communicate with hosts using a globally unique IP address. NAT is primarily an IPv4 concept. IPv6 discourages the use of NAT, because its creators believed it causes more problems than it solves. Under certain circumstances beyond the scope of this book, however, a need to rewrite IPv6 addresses may arise.</p> <p>\"The Firm\" has four machines, 1 to 4, which are connected via a network switch and have private IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x range. Machine 4 serves as a router to the Internet and has two network interfaces. One connects the router to The Firm's internal network via the network switch and has a private IP address of 192.168.0.1, while the other connects the router to the Internet and has a valid (dynamic) IP address of 101.102.103.104.</p> <p>Let's say that the user at Machine 2 wishes to look at a web page on Some Host (http://SomeHost.example) with an IP address of 201.202.203.204. To be able to see the web page, Machine 2 must be able to get information from the Internet and thus must be, in some way, connected to the Internet. And indeed, Machine 2 has an indirect connection to the Internet via Machine 4, but how can this work? Machine 2 has a private IP address which is not supported (routed) on the Internet!</p> <p>This is where NAT kicks in. Machine 4, the router, replaces the private IP address of Machine 2 (and also of Machine 1 and 3 if needed) with its own IP address before sending the request to Some Host. Some Host thinks that a machine with IP address 101.102.103.104 asked for the web page and responds by sending the web page to Machine 4.</p> <p>Machine 4 knows that it has replaced the IP address of Machine 2 with its own before sending the request to Some Host so it also knows that the answer it got to the request has to go to Machine 2. Machine 4 accomplishes this by replacing its own IP address in the answer by the IP address of Machine 2.</p> <p>This is in a nutshell how NAT works.

The kernel's connection tracking keeps track of all the connections when the interface is taken down and brought back up. This is not the case when using MASQUERADE.

These definitions describe certain characteristics that when met, trigger off an alert or countermeasure. If a detection takes place and is correct, we call this a true positive. If a detection takes place but is inaccurate, this is called a false positive.. When the system does not detect something that does not occur, this is called a true negative. When there actually is an event which is not detected by the system, this is called a false negative.</p> <p>Often, the detection capabilities of the IDS are expanded by using heuristic detection methods. In order for these to be both effective and accurate, the system needs to be trained. During this period, a lot of false positives may be detected which isn't a bad thing. But the system needs to be tweaked so the amount of false positives will be reduced to a minimum. A false negative is equal to having no IDS in place, and is the most undesirable behavior for an IDS.</p>"},{"location":"lpic2.212.4/#keeping-track-of-security-alerts","title":"Keeping track of security alerts","text":"<p>Security alerts are warnings about vulnerabilities in certain pieces security alerts of software.
