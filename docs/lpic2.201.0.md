# Linux Kernel (201) 

This topic has a total weight of 9 points and contains the following
three objectives:

##  Objective 201.1: Kernel Components (weight: 2)

-   Candidates should be able to utilize kernel components that are
    necessary to specific hardware, hardware drivers, system resources
    and requirements. This objective includes implementing different
    types of kernel images, understanding stable and longterm kernels
    and patches, as well as using kernel modules.

##  Objective 201.2: Compiling a Linux kernel (weight: 3)

-   Candidates should be able to properly configure a kernel to include
    or disable specific features of the Linux kernel as necessary. This
    objective includes compiling and recompiling the Linux kernel as
    needed, updating and noting changes in a new kernel, creating an
    `initrd` image and installing new kernels.

##  Objective 201.3: Kernel runtime management and troubleshooting (weight: 4)

   - Candidates should be able to manage and/or query a 2.6.x, 3.x or 4.x
    kernel and its loadable modules. Candidates should be able to
    identify and correct common boot and run time issues. Candidates
    should understand device detection and management using udev. This
    objective includes troubleshooting udev rules.
